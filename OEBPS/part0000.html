      <p> PREFACE.</p>
      <p> "Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me. Oh ... that mine adversary had written a book."</p>
      <p> THIS history,  which has  been nearly twenty years in making,  was originally intended solely for the members of the family, but as time went on the hope grew that it might also be of interest to  others as  a  picture of the  inhabitants of the Scottish Lowlands,   whose manners and  customs  formed  so distinctive a  feature of the country and who played such a prominent part in its story.</p>
      <p> As it is actually written, however, for the family only, I have not hesitated to make frequent extracts from other authors, notably from the late Professor John Veitch, with whom I had a pleasant correspondence concerning this work. I feel that the highest tribute I can pay to him, the greatest authority on Scottish Border history, is to quote from him. He, himself, kindly said that my name and the ancient relations between our two families were more than sufficient apology, and I have, as well, since received kind permission to the same effect from his publishers, Messrs. Blackwood &amp; Sons, of Edinburgh. I also gratefully acknowledge the kindness of Mr. R. M. Hay and Mr. F. S. Hay in allowing access to the ancient documents in the Charter room at Duns Castle, and for enabling photographs to be made of them ; and I have as well to express my thanks to the many other persons who have assisted me at the cost of much time and trouble to themselves.</p>
      <p> For the sake of convenience I have adopted the general spelling of the name as Tweedie, as being the more usual, at all events in Scotland ; it is, however, found in  the ancient documents in every conceivable form,  Tuedy,</p>
      <p> viii.   Preface.</p>
      <p> Twyddie, Tweedy, Tweedie, Twedy, Twedie, Tweidie, and many other ways, and except by reason of custom and usage in any particular branch, no one form is more correct or authentic than another. Whenever, however, this custom and usage exists,   I  have adhered to it.</p>
      <p> In spite of the care I have spent on the work, I am only too well aware of its many imperfections, for which I ask the indulgence of the reader. Perhaps, some day, when the index and printing of the Public Records of Scotland are completed,  some one  may be found to complete this story.</p>
      <p> I would add that the pedigrees in the Appendix are not given in any pride of descent, but to place on record the information that has developed itself in the course of the work. Genealogical details are, perhaps, of more than ordinary interest in this case, because not only is the surname borne by a very limited number of people, but it is of such a purely local character that it always denotes, if not actual kinship, at least a definite connection with the district of Tweeddale, which is, beyond all doubt, the source whence all Tweedies come.</p>

      <p> THE HISTORY</p>
      <p> OF THE</p>
      <p> TWEEDIE,   or TWEEDY,   FAMILY.</p>
      <p> CHAPTER I. TEN CENTURIES AGO.</p>
      <p> WHENCE they came, who they were, and what manner of men they may have been, is the natural thought  of every  man  about his Ancestors ; it is but a matter of sentiment, and of less importance than what manner of men we are, and whither we are going, yet it is doubtful which question has received, and does receive, the more consideration.</p>
      <p> We venture to think that pride of race and family is not altogether undesirable, for, as Tennyson tells us, " Ev'n the homely farm can teach us, there is something in descent." Ever since the Creation, the " family " has been the unit of all good government, of all order, and all organization, and its prosperity the keynote of all success ; the knowledge that he has a good family record to maintain, and a name to uphold, has often done much to sustain a man in the hour of need ; and it is indeed in this knowledge that the practical value of a recorded history of a family lies, quite apart from its antiquarian  interest.</p>
      <p> It was a feeling of this kind that first suggested the idea of collecting the</p>
      <p> records of the Tweedies.    The search for the earliest traces of the family takes</p>
      <p> one back into the dark distance of the ages where all beginnings would  be lost</p>
      <p> for ever but for the  indistinct  glimmerings of  tradition  which  have  reached</p>
      <p> us ; but  more  fortunate than many  families,   the Tweedies can  quote from</p>
      <p> the  Master of all Scottish tradition the legend of their  origin,   which is</p>
      <p> related in the  preface to  "The  Betrothed," as  follows:—"Scottish  tradition ttbe JSctrotbeO</p>
      <p> ascribes to the  Clan of Tweedie, a family once  stout  and warlike, a descent g co tt (preface).</p>
      <p> which would not have  misbecome a hero of  antiquity.    A baron, somewhat</p>
      <p> elderly, we may suppose, had wedded a buxom young lady, and some months [ as t flMnetrcl.</p>
      <p> after  their union he  went to the Crusades and left her  to ply the distaffawen&amp;fcCanto (.</p>
      <p> r J 5tati3a jil.</p>
      <p> alone in his old tower,   among the mountains of  the County of Peebles, mote Ifc. near  the source  of  the Tweed.     He returned after seven or eight years— no uncommon time for a  pilgrimage to Palestine—and found his family had not  been lonely in his absence ;   the lady having been cheered by the</p>
      <p> Ibomer's</p>
      <p> ©&amp;B66CB</p>
      <p> JSooft if.</p>
      <p> arrival of a stranger (of whose approach she could give the best account of any one) who hung on her skirts and called her mammy, and who was just such as the baron would have longed to call his son, could he have made his age correspond, according to the doctrine of civilians, with his own departure for Palestine. He applied to his wife, therefore, for the solution of this dilemma. The lady, after many floods of tears which she had reserved for the occasion, informed the honest gentleman, that walking one day alone by the banks of the infant river, a human form arose from a deep eddy still known and termed Tweed pool, who deigned to inform her that he was the tutelar genius of the stream, and,  bongre, malgre,  became the father of the sturdy fellow, whose appearance had so much surprised her husband. This story, however suitable to Pagan times, would have met with full credence from few of the baron's contemporaries, had not the wife been young and beautiful, the husband old and in his dotage. Her family (the Frasers, it is believed) were powerful and warlike, and the baron had had fighting enough in the holy wars. The result was, that he believed or seemed to believe the tale, and remained contented with the child with whom his wife and the Tweed had generously presented him. The only circumstance which preserved the memory of the incident, was that the youth retained the name of Tweed or Tweedie. The baron, meanwhile, could not, as the old Scotch songs says, ' keep the cradle rowing,' and the Tweed apparently thought one natural son was family enough for a decent Presbyterian lover. So  little  gall had the baron in his composition, that having bred up the young Tweed as his heir while he lived, he left him in that capacity when he died, and the son of the river-god founded the family of Drummelzier and others, from whom have flowed, in the phrase of the Ettrick Shepherd, " Many a brave fellow and many a bauld feat."</p>
      <p> The legend of a river becoming the father of a child is a very ancient one—quite classical in fact,—compare, for instance, Homer's account of Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus, King of Elis, and the birth of the twin  Kings,  Pelias and Neleus, her sons:—</p>
      <p> " For fair Enipeus as from fruitful urns, He pours his watery stores the Virgin burns; Smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride, And in soft masses rolls a silver tide. As on his banks the maid enamoured roves, The monarch of the deep beholds and loves; In her Enipeus' form and borrowed charms, The amorous god descends into her arms; "</p>
      <p> A pool in Tweed, near Drummelzier, is still called the " Devil's Pool," and tradition  says  that  the  family name was originally Tweedeil  or</p>

      <p> Tweed devil, and thus subsequently Tweedie ; this is, however, of course, mere tradition and nothing more, and has no real basis of truth. The first recorded form of the name is de Tueda, as of a man living in the reign of Alexander II., but in whatever shape it may be found, there seems no doubt that the origin is the same, although, after the manner of the times, it is spelt in many different ways, the same individual's name being sometimes differently rendered even in the same document; Tuedy, Tuedi, Tweedy, Twedy, Tueday, Tuedie, Tweedie, Twidy, Twedie, Tweidie, Tueidie, and even Twyddie, being a few examples in point. It was not until comparatively modern times that any uniformity was observed, but for the sake of convenience it is proposed to keep to one spelling of the name, except when an actual quotation is given, or reference made to any branch of the family which has definitely adopted another form of the name, and no one form is more correct or authentic than another. All of the name, no doubt, sprung either direct from the common ancestor who first assumed the surname from the river on which he dwelt, or from one of his followers; for it was not unusual in those wild lawless days for men to adopt the surname of the patron under whose protection they gathered, and to whom they were united by the common danger in bonds as strong as actual relationship, even if such did not already exist between them.</p>
      <p> It is however, with the days before feudal times, although subsequent to traditionary ages, that we propose first to deal, and we cannot find  a  better  guide than Professor Veitch,   the  great authority  on ibistocv? anO</p>
      <p> the district of the upper reaches of the river Tweed, for it is in Drummelzier, </p>
      <p> Hopkelloch,  Kilbucho, and Oliver, and the adjoining country, that we 2 vole., bp.</p>
      <p> find the family resident in the earliest days of  its recorded history, when       C660r   e c ''</p>
      <p> surnames first began to come into use.</p>
      <p> Professor Veitch tells us  that "  this  district,   the land of foray and feud, of hostile inroad from  England, and of aggression in return, has been the heart whence strong bold action,   the gradual  growth of  history, tradition, legend, the continuous flow of song, ballad and music have moved Iblstocg ano the feelings and moulded the imagination not only of  the people of  the gcotttib JBorOcr district but, of the whole land of Scotland."   vol. (.p.3.</p>
      <p> The nature of the Country has probably changed but little, except perhaps that it was in early times clothed with birch and woods of a like nature. The Celtic inhabitants were found by the Romans in their forests, and many of the names throughout all the Border Country are indicative ©rcen, "/iBahfng of felling and clearing. The land was a forest wherever soil and elevation ° " 9 an  ' permitted wood to grow, all part, no doubt, of the great and ancient forest of Caledon,  Coit Celidon,  and it is possible that the name Gadeni or Cadeni, borne by the ancient inhabitants of at least a portion of the Border</p>

      <p> district, meant dwellers in the wood. No doubt the hill-tops were as bare in the old times as now, but in the valleys and glens grew the birch, sallow thorn, mountain ash, and alder, forming a dense underwood with the Scotch fir, ash, and oak, juniper, bracken, fern, and common heather on the higher slopes, giving a fair picture of the Country in the times when Cymri and Angles held the land. Game of all kind was abundant, bird and beast of chase, red deer and roe deer,—even as late as the days of James V. and Mary, and for many years afterwards.</p>
      <p> All down the stretch of Tweed, "the flood of Tweed," as it is called in the Border Laws, stands out the line of the now ruinous old castles and peels, of which many were held by Tweedies, such as Oliver Castle in the upper reaches, Wrae Castle, Drummelzier Castle, and Tinnies Castle; they extend over a hundred miles of country, memorials of the incidents and struggles of the Border, and of its old rough life.</p>
      <p> It is beyond the scope of our present work to enquire who were the people that in the past lived in this district, or to what races they belonged, our interest only begins when we first find signs that the dwellers in these ancient towers and castles were possibly the ancestors of the family which subsequently held the district for many years.</p>
      <p> The names of these castles and peels, to say nothing of the hills and streams on which they stand, point clearly to the owners having originally been that Cymric people who occupied the greater portion of the Lowlands for several centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, and who made such a gallant struggle against Pict and Angle and Scot to maintain their footing in those wilds. These forts were their last places of retreat in that district, and their last strongholds there were the Border Hills of Scotland, ere they were finally subdued, and emigrated from the district or were merged in the Kingdom of Scotland. Curiously enough the information obtained from Ptolemy and other historians confirms the supposition that the inhabitants of the valleys of the Tweed and the Clyde, at the dawn of history, were identical with those of Wales and Cornwall.</p>
      <p> Coming to comparatively modern times, it is a matter of history that after the successes of William the Conqueror, or " Conquestor "—as is written on his tomb in Caen—many of the original Saxon landowners emigrated northwards from England and actually reached Scotland. The Conquest, as it is called, really took seven years to complete in England, those who resisted being treated as rebels, and their lands being forfeited.</p>
      <p> Many persons of importance fled northwards to Scotland, and there was in that direction a constant stream of Saxon emigration, which appears to have continued even down to the time of David I , when to this Saxon current was added a flow of French and Normans. We find from the early charters of David I., his brothers, and the Alexanders, that the Celtic names</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-5"/>
      <p> had gradually disappeared from places of importance in the Lowlands of Scotland, and the whole language ultimately formed and spoken there came to be a fusion of Angle,  Danish, and Saxon.</p>
      <p> At the Battle of the Standard, in 1138, the " Tevidalenses," that is, the people of Teviotdale and Tweeddale, formed with the Cumbrenses, the second division of the Scots, and the latest reference we have to the dwellers in the district as a distinct race, is in the reign of Malcom IV., about 1165. After that they seem to have been wholly merged in the general population and the language known as Angle, or the broad vowelled branch of the Saxon, became the spoken language of the country.</p>
      <p> This confusion of tongues points  to  a  large  immigration   from "Ibtstore ano Northumbria and probably other parts of England, and the charter lists of scottlab JBorocr the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  show a  great preponderance  of Anglo-vo1  *• Saxon and Anglo-Norman names of persons on the Tweed.    No doubt many good Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman families settled in the  Lowlands about the time of David  I.,  who encouraged them, and had a bodyguard of " Milites Angli et  Franci," or Anglian and Norman Knights,   at the Battle of the Standard,  it was to these " Milites Angli et Franci"  especially that f "I 5 !" 11 * £ bron-he gave estates on Tweedside, and it is here at this time, and as barons and landowners that we find the first historical record of  the Family of Tweedie.    The men to whom David gave estates on Tweedside,   and their successors, soon held nearly all the lands along the Tweed and its tributaries.    Each  man built himself a fortalice,   a mill,   and  a brewhouse,   and 3imcs JEarlg surrounded himself with his own followers.    Thus the old Cymric stock in ibigtorg, 10. the south, and in a measure the Gaelic race in the north, were superseded, on the Tweed at all events,  by  men of  Norman,  Flemish,  or  Saxon blood, and probably from this stock  sprang  the  ancestors  of those who now bear the surname of  Tweedie, or Tweedy, or any  of the kindred  renderings of the name.     The word Tweed is the Cymric Tywi, from the root Twy, and Ibtstorg ano probably means "  that which limits,   checks or  bounds,"  Twyad in Welsh Scottish ffioroer meaning  "a hemming in"  Robertson gives the Gaelic,  Tuath-aid "  the river p '</p>
      <p> flowing to the north side,"  but the oldest spelling of the name favours the other derivation, Bede writes Tuid and in 1185 it is written Tuede, and the family surname no doubt arose from the original holders describing themselves, as is evident from the records, as John, or Thomas, as the case might be, " de Tueda," John of the Tweed, then John Tueda, or Tuede, and so Tweedie or Twedy.</p>
      <p> At the first it is difficult to even guess at the personalities that these far away records disclose, for surnames were yet to be adopted, and a man was only known either by the lands he held, or as the son of his father, or by some such indefinite description, but in some cases even this still points to certain individuals as  ancestors.</p>

      <p> possession which  was inherited by the Tweedies through  marriage  with</p>
      <p> an  heiress,  we may  fairly conjecture that Boed or  Buht,  and Gillielmus or</p>
      <p> Gylis,   were lineal ancestors of the Tweedies  living about the  year 1066,</p>
      <p> the time  of the Norman Conquest of  England.</p>

      <p> CHAPTER  II.</p>
      <p> THE DAWN  OF  RECORD.</p>
      <p> T is a long step from legend and inference to history, but it is one which, when once made, lands us upon trustworthy ground where the searcher feels himself almost  in  personal touch  with the past.</p>
      <p> anquigtt y^g fj rS £  man wnom we fl nc j mentioned in the records by the surname</p>
      <p> Generates.   J</p>
      <p> which the family has borne through so many ages is  one Johannes de</p>
      <p> ?°ftp b 2l0 S0ftbat iueda &gt;  as ne  described himself in the reign of Alexander II. He afterwards had a Charter from Alexander  III.  granted  him  under the name of John de a.©. 1214—1249. Xuedy, and this would have been about the years 1214-1249. It is on record that he was the owner of lands on the river Tweed from which the family took their name, and that even then the family connections and possessions  were widespread and powerful.</p>
      <p> The next step brings us to documents which put us at the present day  into  direct  view of the dawn of  record.</p>
      <p> In the Charter room at Duns Castle are some ancient writs and charters, so ancient indeed that some time since their mere interest as such prompted an antiquarian, searching there for other purposes, to make a note of them. In subsequent days chance led him to hear of this present work, and realising that these ancient documents were of first importance to it he gave information which led to their careful consideration. They turned out to be the original writs and charters of the family of Tweedie dating from the year  1314 to the year  1633.</p>
      <p> Their presence at Duns Castle is accounted for by the fact that in the year 1633, Drummelzier Castle, up  till  then the chief seat of the Tweedies, passed into the possession of Lord Hay of Yester who made it over to his younger son. His descendants subsequently parted with the property, but retained, as of no value, the old charters and writs which had gone with Drummelzier when it left the hands of the Tweedies; and they have lain in the Charter room ever since at Duns Castle, by the kind leave of whose owner inspection has been permitted of these interesting old records.</p>
      <p> With these writs and charters and the documents on the public registers, begins the recorded and accurate history of the family, upon which we will enter without further comment.</p>

      <p> The earliest of these charters and writs of the family  refers to a.©. 1296.</p>
      <p> Fynley de Twydyn, "del Comte de Lanarke" (of the County of Lanark), an undoubted ancestor, who did homage to Edward I. of England on his assuming ffamtlg.</p>
      <p> sovereign  rights over  Scotland.      This Fynley or  Fynlaw had a son named 5 a , s " 1an 1Ro11</p>

      <p> Roger,   who married  one of  the  co-heiresses (the  eldest daughter),   of Sir parocbiales 1,</p>
      <p> William  Fraser of Oliver Castle, son of Sir Simon Fraser, so celebrated in p *</p>
      <p> the days of  Bruce,   and it was through her the estates of Drummelzier</p>
      <p> and  Oliver came  into possession of the family of  Tweedie.     This marriage anoerson's 1btst.</p>
      <p> may have taken place at any time between 1296 and 1329, but probably</p>
      <p> during the reign of David  II.       Roger was evidently a person of some</p>
      <p> importance,   and apparently even then used the arms which  the family</p>
      <p> of  Tweedie carry at the present day, as  we learn  from  subsequent  records</p>
      <p> that  he bore on his shield:    argent a saltire engrailed gules  a chief azure;</p>
      <p> along with which he  displayed the arms of Fraser in  right of  his wife,</p>
      <p> the  heiress,    but  the  Fraser  Quartering  was   afterwards  discontinued</p>
      <p> some time  between the years 1500  and 1600.    Mary,   the other  co-heiress</p>
      <p> of Sir   William    Fraser,      married,      in   1308,     Sir    Gilbert    Hay  of</p>
      <p> Lockerward.</p>
      <p> Among the most ancient possessions of the family was Hopcailzie, JTwceo ano otbec and on the  28th  August,   1296,  "William  le  Hopkelioghe" is found as one of the tenants of the  King in the County of Peebles,   but whether he was actually an ancestor or not  is unknown ;   he swore  fealty  to Edward  I.  at Berwick-upon-Tweed.      His seal  is described as "  Vesica shape Lion passant ^aht's to  Sinister"     and  lettered  "  Willelmi de Hopcailov."       He is  also on pp. 202—533. record as  holding  the  lands of  Westerhopkeliov  and Esterhopkeliov of  the ©0. pp. 424, 42S. King, and a little  later on he obtains leave from the  King to lease certain _  m    ,_,_ portions of these lands,   the consideration or  rent for  which is not uninteresting:   "12 Chalders of provender, a Suitor at  the Court of Peebles,   2—130 . "a  3rd  of  a Knights service in  the  King's Scottish  Army and  a  Man for j 3 ' 0 5. "8 days to keep the road through  Minehe  Moor free from robbers."</p>
      <p> In a humble way, illustrative of the times, we find among the garrison Cbronic.  tibem.</p>

      <p> In the year  1314,  Robert the Bruce,  King of Scots,  made a grant to B.2&gt;. 1314.</p>
      <p> his beloved and faithful  Roger (who  we have already mentioned),   the son</p>
      <p> of Fynlaw de Twydyn, of all the lands which belonged to  John of Seton,</p>
      <p> within the tenement of Cornokis, in  recompense of the damage sustained by Original (Ibarras</p>
      <p> Roger in consequence of John of Seaton and his brother having abducted  g nm ^</p>
      <p> the " Equitinium "   of Roger.     The original of  this document is still in</p>
      <p> existence, and is dated at Ayr,   18th December,   8th  year  of the reign of</p>
      <p> Robert the Bruce, and it seems probable that Roger must have fought for</p>
      <p> the Bruce, and John of Seton on the other, and losing side.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-12"/>
      <p> What the "Equitinium" was that was stolen is a matter of some doubt, as there is no such word to be found in classical Latin, but it may be a mistake for equitium, meaning a stud of horses, a valuable appendage of the landowner of those days. Can John have descended upon Roger, and got clear away with his horses ? And if so, was that all he took ? We think, knowing the spirit of the times, it did not probably stop there, and a curious picture is conjured up of a sudden attack, stampeded cattle and horses, and blows and cries in  the darkness of  a certain night; in the year</p>
      <p> I3I4-a.®. 1320.   In the year 1320, this same Roger, the son of Fynlaw of Twydyn,</p>
      <p> acquired the house,   brewhouse,   yard,   and lands in  Drummelzier,   which</p>

      <p> in  Kilbucho.</p>
      <p> a.©. 1326.   In the year  1326, and possibly on the occasion of the marriage of his</p>
      <p> daughter to Roger,   Sir William Fraser granted  to Roger the Barony of</p>

      <p> This marriage of the daughter of a local family to a stranger probably gave rise to the tradition of the mythological origin of the Family of Tweedie. The common people, whose ignorance usually gives birth to all legends, found a stranger among them whose presence and power they could not account for, and whose origin they accordingly put down to supernatural causes; a tradition that was not likely to lose in strength for the want of a little additional colouring as the legend passed down from mouth to mouth through successive generations of a credulous and superstitious peasantry.</p>
      <p> In  much  the same way  local traditions claim for the district other supernatural  characters,    such as Jack the Giant  Killer,    King  Arthur, Iblatorg and Thomas the  Rhymer, and the Wizard  Merlin.    Thus a legend prevalent  in</p>
      <p> Scottleb JBorocr. the parish of Tweedsmuir relates how a person of diminutive stature, called Little-John, from behind a boulder discharged an arrow at a freebooter of gigantic proportions who, though standing on the opposite side of the Tweed, could not elude the deadly stroke, and was buried on the spot where he fell. This incident is considered the origin of the well known story of Jack the Giant Killer, and if any there be who disbelieve it, all that can be said is,  that there  is the legend, that a tumulus in which human remains</p>
      <p> accoimf atlBtlCal nave been found is sti11 P oin ted out as the "Giant's grave," and that if any further evidence be wanted, to this  very  day the  boulder can be seen</p>

The whole district is pervaded with the fame of Thomas of Erceldoune, or Thomas the Rhymour ot Erceldoune, or simply Thomas the Rhymour, and it is the best known name with which a definite work is associated. The historical facts abou«t this soothsayer are but few, and they are mostly given by Sir Walter Scott in his notice of him in the Minstrelsy. He lived some time in the thirteenth century, in the hamlet of Erceldoune, now Earlston, and even in his lifetime he was regarded as a seer and foreteller of the future, and as having a mysterious connection with the land of Faerii. The story of his end is, that he disappeared from his grey tower in Erceldoune one day in response to a supernatural call and was never seen again.</p>
      <p> About King Arthur,   his personality and exploits,   so  great a conflict ^jj£** ( g| 0f has raged that we  refrain  from entering into  it  further than  to say Berlin, that local  legends claim the Tweeddale district  to  have  been  the  scene  ofScoJtflSinatreteB his life,   his battles,   and his death.    " A mystery to  the world,"  says the old Bard,   " is the grave of  Arthur" ; and a mystery to the world is the story of his life,  as far as we  know  it  now.     But for  a masterly treatment of the Arthurian  Legend we would refer  our  readers  to  the fifth  chapter of the  first  volume of  Professor Veitch's " History and Poetry of the Scottish Border,"   and advise them to see for themselves the wonderful picture of the past conjured  up by the  learned Professor before making up their  minds on the subject.</p>

With this near relationship between them and the leading characters of the day, we may be sure that the Tweedies took an active part in all the long and terrible wars that then raged, when there was nothing but fighting, the making of prisoners, battles, and the wounding and slaying of men innumerable, when, as Sir Walter says, "there was no finding any refuge or protection but in the strongest arm and the longest sword ; when there was no raising of crops, no religious devotion, and all the laws of humanity and charity were transgressed without scruple ; when whole families were found starved to death, even cannibalism being resorted to, and the whole country reduced to a most disastrous state." a,2&gt;. 1355.   The Douglas family about this time appear to have been allies of the</p>
      <p> Tweedies, and to have exerted themselves in their interests, for on the 8th December, 1355, letters of regress (or pardon) were issued by Robert, the Steward of Scotland, Lieutenant of the King, in favour of James of Tweedie, because the Lord of Douglas had received him to the faith and peace of the King. This was Tweedie of Drummelzier, and he must have ©rtginal Charters been in trouble of some sort. These letters were confirmed by David II., Gweeote.   King of Scots, at Perth, on the 4th  July,  1360, five  years afterwards.    It</p>

In the meanwhile, William Douglas had shown great courage and skill in regaining the Borders for the Kingdom of Scotland, and it was no doubt in respect of some arrangement arrived at with James of Tweedie in regard to this, that this charter was granted, probably to secure Tweedie's co-operation in the fighting which resulted in the retreat of Edward III. from Scotland and the liberation of David II.</p>

      <p> we  find  mention  of  a  '' William  de Tuedi"  in matters  connected with  the Borough of  Peebles.</p>
      <p> James of Tuedy of Drummelzier was made her nominee by Jonet S.XD. t389. of Graham, Lady of Watchtone, by a document dated 8th February, 1389,  jj -|r 0 .  ie9. for the purposes of  dealing with the lands of  Hartree.</p>
      <p> From the year 1388, with the exception of the last-mentioned incident, the records are silent for thirty years, an entire generation, and we think the reason is not far to seek. 1388 was the year of Otterbourne, and, although the number of Scots and English engaged in that fight were not great, but few indeed of those on either side returned. Amongst the slain no doubt were many Tweedies, for their intimate relations with Douglas make it sure that they supported him in that and every other quarrel, and the old ballad says of the followers of Douglas that " They are born along by the water of Tweed,"   that is,  were natives of Tweeddale.</p>
      <p> The story of the fight is historical. In August, 1388, James, the Second Earl of Douglas, made a raid into Northumberland, laid waste a great part of the district, and finally met Henry Percy, or Hotspur, in single combat before the new Castle, winning from him his pennon, which he declared he would carry back to Scotland as a trophy. This Percy swore he should never do, and pursuing the Scots as they retired homewards came up with them at Fawdoun Hill on the east side of the Otter-bourne at nightfall. The battle raged throughout the entire night, and finally ended in a victory for the Scots, who captured and  carried off</p>
      <p> Percy and  his brother.      The accounts vary as to the number of  men *~l 0CB  * n ^.. , 3 3 ,   Ipoctrg Scottfsb</p>
      <p> engaged, but a recent discovery at Elsdon Church,  about three  miles from JBoroer vol. if.</p>
      <p> the scene of  the conflict, may be  regarded as throwing some light on  the</p>
      <p> slaughter.    There skulls to the amount of a thousand have been disinterred,</p>
      <p> all lying together.      They belong to lads in their teens,   and to young</p>
      <p> and middle-aged men ;   but there are no skulls of  old men,   or women.</p>
      <p> Probably these are  the dead of Otterbourne,   perhaps of one side and</p>
      <p> perhaps of the other, or perhaps of  both ;   and if, as is likely, the  manhood</p>
      <p> of the family of Tweedie fell at Otterbourne along with that of  many</p>
      <p> other Border families, the silence of the next thirty years is well accounted</p>

      <p> From the History of the Cockburns of that  Ilk  we learn that in 1451 James, the elder son of Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier, married Margaret Giffert, the widow of James Cockburn, and that Patrick, a younger son of Walter Tweedie, married Mariota, a daughter of Alexander Cockburn of Skirling and Cessford. Patrick appears to have held the cockburns of lands of Hopkelloch or Hopkailzie, a posession of the Tweedie family tbat *  p " 220, usually occupied by one  of  its cadets.</p>

      <p> charter  must  have  been  made  in the midst of all the stirring events  which</p>
      <p> followed hard upon  the  chivalrous visit of Sir Patrick Gray,   the Captain</p>
      <p> of the  King's Guard,  to  the  Castle  of  Thrieve in  Galloway.    At  this time</p>
      <p> the  Douglas family, the Hamiltons and  all whom they could collect  to their</p>
      <p> support,  were in  arms and engaged  in  active warfare  against  the King,  to</p>
      <p> avenge the  murder of the Earl of  Douglas, the father of the 9th  Earl.</p>
      <p> Many battles were fought in different parts of Scotland between thettalesofa forces of the King and the Douglasses and their allies, among whom  c ^ Vt  rxi. would appear to have been the Tweedies. Much blood was spilt and great mischief done to the country ; famine and pestilence followed, and the land was everywhere desolate and wasted by civil wars, conflagrations and slaughters, until at length, in 1453, the power of the Douglasses was broken at the battle of Arkinholme  in  the valley of the Esk.</p>
      <p> For- a long period the only sort of organisation in support of law and order that availed on the Borders was that of Clanship and the system of the blood feud which it involved. A blow for a blow and a life for a life was the only code of the blood feud. It was the one check on brute Iblstorg ano force and violence ; and it helps us to understand the social life and history scottisb JBoroer of the Borderers. Occupying an isolated portion of the country between  ro1,   "• p * 3 ** England and Scotland, and having to depend chiefly on themselves for protection from the Southern foe and from each other, the combination of clans and families was perfectly natural, and thus we need not wonder at at the rise and subsistence through centuries of the family feuds which appear to us so bloody and disgraceful. The feeling of revenge for injury to the person and for violent death is a trait of character which the Low-lander inherited from his Anglo-Saxon ancestry. It is derived no doubt from the instinctive feeling that the person of a man is the most sacred thing about him, and that any injury done to him must be wiped out in blood, a feeling which is in reality just as strong with us to-day, but modern ideas and training teach us to repress it. The whole social history of life on the Borders  is  full of instances.      Even  the Church for</p>

      <p> a time recognised the power if not the propriety of the system. It was long customary in the Border Counties to leave the right hand of male children unchristened that it might deal the more deadly, in fact the more unhallowed, blow to the enemy. Now this may seem a shocking sentiment, and no doubt it would not be justifiable under any perfect system of social law and order. But in those trying times there was no protection for the weak or the injured, and the certainty of punishment under this system was in fact the only restraint in those lawless days on the wrongdoer and the oppressor; and the moral right of self-defence, and the duty of administering punishment, where the law was powerless to protect the injured or punish the aggressor, had risen to a very positive ethical code. The nearest kinsman of the injured or slain was bound to take up the quarrel and the duty of revenge, his kinsmen were bound to support him, and any relative of the man who had done the wrong was liable to have the wrath of the avenger directed against him. Family feuds of the deadliest sort thus naturally continued from father to son through many generations, and in dealing with such a state of things it is very difficult properly to apportion the blame. Even in the time of James VI. there is a certain recognition in the Acts of his Parliament of the intrinsic propriety of the custom, at least of its use and wont, and of the necessity of making allowance for the mutual reprisals that had  taken place.</p>
      <p> We now come to the first record of one of the many of these feuds in which this family was, and no doubt had been, embroiled for years. Probably they occurred more often than they were recorded, and similar " cruel slauchteris" had, no doubt, been going on for ages between the Tweedies and their neighbours. On the i8th November, 1458, Roger Tweedie and Walter Tweedie (a son of John Tweedie of Dreva) were killed, how and why we know not, by Sir William Cockburn of Henderland, Sir William Cockburn of Skirling, and James Cockburn, the brother of the latter. The great want of variety in christian names, and of any mention in the records of relationships, and indeed the poverty of the actual records, which contain little more than the meagre facts, render the task of framing any consecutive story an exceedingly difficult one throughout, and it is only by inference that anything like a connected history can be pieced together. In this particular case the whole affair is shrouded in doubt, not only of what the facts were, but also of how those concerned came to be mixed up in the quarrel. All that can be ascertained is, that Patrick Tweedie, a son of Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier (no doubt the man already referred to as far back as 1434), had married Mariota, the daughter of Alexander Cockburn, whilst James Tweedie, the elder son, had married Margaret Giffert, the widow of James Cockburn, and that there seems to have been some  difficulty over  the  ownership of the lands of</p>

      <p> Hopkelloch or Hopcailzie. This affray seems to have taken place in the streets of Edinburgh during the sitting of Parliament, Walter Tweedie of Dreva was killed as we have seen, his sword and shield were carried off by the Cockburns, and an Andrew Tweedie was also ''grievously" wounded, for all of which the Cockburns were ordered to " satisfy " the Tweedies with whom and the Veitchs of Dawick they are stated to have had, at this time, a " deidly feid "; and no doubt, for years after, reprisals went on over the affair.</p>
      <p> In the town  repositories at  Peebles,   there is an original charter  a 2&gt; -1+62. granted by  ''Sir Walter Scott,  Knight, Lord of Bukcluch and Kyrkowd,"-Recot&amp;g 1-llov. giving  an annual rent from his lands to  ''my  beloved Cousin James of 1462, Tuede, Lord of Drummelzier (undoubtedly the husband of Margaret Giffert), for his manifold counsels, helps and  benefits rendered to me."     The seal and  the document are both in excellent condition.</p>
      <p> This Sir Walter Scott had much to do with the ultimate triumph of the king over the powerful family of Douglas, and the downfall of that sept, and it is curious to find a record of this nature after what we have Scott Gales of a seen of the intimate relations between Tweedie and the Earl of Douglas  c t, a p. jjf. only eight years before. At the same time, it is noteworthy that Hamilton, who apparently was also on similar terms of intimacy with Douglas, actually rose into power on the fall of the latter.</p>
      <p> The Charter Chest of the Archives of the  Earls of Wigtown at 8-B\ 1465. Cumbernauld contains a document dated  10th February,   1465, under which ^Bier's "ftist. of Robert Lord  Fleming,   Gilbert Lord  Kennedy,   and Sir Alexander Boyd p. 63. agreed to maintain a certain " Wat of Twedy"   in all his causes and quarrels.    Who he was exactly cannot be ascertained, but from what we know of the relations of the Tweedie family with their neighbours,   he probably had very good reasons of his own for making  arrangements for effective and defensive alliances.    It is possible that he was Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier himself.</p>
      <p> The family appears, however, at the same time, to have been held  in a.©. 1467.</p>
      <p> esteem,   for in the year 1467 amongst the persons ordained by Act of jpacUamcnt of</p>
      <p> Parliament to make certain enquiries at  Peebles,   we find "ye lord of ScotlanO vol. if.</p>
      <p> Drumellior;"   and  in  1468,   George  Tweedie  seems  to have  acted on j^jp.1468.</p>

      <p> March, 1470, James Tweedie of Drummelzier formed one of the jury at Edinburgh, who acquitted Andrew Ker of Cessfurde, when put upon his trial " for the traitorous in bringing of James Douglas, traitor, from England within Scotland, and for treasonable communing with divers Englishmen to the hurt of the King, his realm and Lieges," and possibly it was fortunate for Andrew Ker that he had a friend on the jury at this crisis in his fortunes.</p>
      <p> James Tweedie of Drummelzier handed over to "James Tweedie the son and apparent heir of Walter Tweedie and Margaret Gifford the spouse of James," a certain portion of the lands of " Hopkelyou," on the 14th May,  1473.</p>
      <p> A Chaplaincy was founded at the altar ol St. John the Baptist at St. Andrew's church in Peebles, on the 15th December, 1473, when James Tweedie of Drummelzier (the son and apparent heir of Walter Tweedie), and Margaret Giffert his spouse with other persons, granted the patronage of the Altar to the Bailies and Community of Peebles. It was founded, more particularly, in honour of King James III. and his Queen Margaret, and for the souls of James Tweedie of Drummelzier and some others, and of all who had been slain in the wars of those individuals. There were two charters dated the same day and much to the same purpose, and some unexplained mystery seems to surround the proceedings. Probably, the founding of the chaplaincy may have been intended as an expiation for blood spilt in some Border feud, as hardly any other power than the Church could have compelled these warlike and predatory lairds to trouble themselves to such an extent about spiritual matters.</p>
      <p> On the 5th April, 1474, King James  III.  made a grant of the barony of Cessford to Andrew Ker and his wife, Margaret Tweedie, no doubt the same persons as already mentioned under the date of 1450. It must have been their son or grandson, Sir Andrew Ker, described by Sir Walter Scott as a border chief of great power, who made the celebrated defence of the Castle of Fernieherst, the feudal seat of the Kers, against the English under Lord Dacre, in 1523. The castle was taken, but with great loss to the besiegers. In the evening Lord Dacre encamped close by, and about eight at night, when the English were at supper, the camp was rushed by the Scottish men, whom the English had believed to be defeated and dispersed, the horses all cut loose, and fifteen hundred of them charged down upon the Earl of Surrey's camp, where they were received with showers of arrows and volleys of musketry, for the English soldiers thought the Scots were storming their entrenchments. The tumult was so great that the English imputed it to supernatural interference, and even the Earl of Surrey himself alleged that the devil was seen visibly six times during the confusion.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-19"/>
      <p> Walter  Tweedie was  returned  heir of his father,   James Tweedie,   in 2,,2) -l475 -the Barony  of Drummelzier,   on the  4th July,   1475,   as we  see  from the ©riginal Cbartere original writs of  the family.     On the "inquest"   we find Sir William le J*^  a ' wec01c Hay  (Knight), and William le  Hay of Mynzaw, and others,  with six  Seals, and among the same writs we find a  charter  by Walter Tweedie,   granted about  1476 to Thomas Frysale of Frude, to which the witnesses are James a.®. 1476. V K/^ of Douglas of  Balvany, Patrick of Levyngstone of that Ilk, and others.   \   I     /</p>
      <p> Certain members of the family seem to have been inclined to peaceful a.®. 1477. callings, for in the next year we find an Alexander Tweedie, a Burgess  of 1424—1513 Edinburgh,  as  a witness to a  charter  under  which  King James  III.    made P« 262, a grant to one Archibald  Dundas, on the nth of June,  1477;  though after all, if what is gathered from the city  records is  true,   even the Burgesses of Edinburgh  had plenty of  fighting on hand at  that time and for long after,  in  order  to support the  King in his difficulties with  his own turbulent Barons, and  his  more serious  quarrels with his cousin of England,  and the subjects of that  realm on the other side of the Border.</p>
      <p> The next  incident  is  an  example of  " the good old rule,   the simple a.2&gt;. 1478.</p>
      <p> plan, that they should take who have the power, and they should keep who</p>
      <p> can."    Some  time  previous to  the 18th March,   1478, James  Tweedie  and</p>
      <p> Marion of Crechton,   his spouse,   had seized on certain lands known as</p>
      <p> " Gaitstakis,"   belonging 1  to Robert Charters,   son of Robert Charters of ®cte  TLovi&gt;s</p>
      <p> '   &amp;    °   .   '   au&amp;itora p.  79.</p>
      <p> Armisfeld,  and  held  them against him by force, and on that  day Robert</p>
      <p> Charters made formal complaint to the authorities and asked for  redress.</p>
      <p> This matter was  adjourned to " the X. day  of Maii nixt to Cum," but it  is</p>
      <p> to be feared that it never came for Robert Charters, as nothing more  is</p>
      <p> ever  heard of him,  and  if Robert  was  not actually  put  quietly beyond the</p>
      <p> power of  making further trouble, he no  doubt  received  a sufficient warning</p>
      <p> of what might happen.    There was in those days a rough and ready method</p>
      <p> in Tweeddale of dealing with troublesome  people,   and there is  talk yet</p>
      <p> of the  terrible knob of stone at Drummelzier that was used as a gallows,</p>
      <p> as it also was elsewhere, and was seldom without a corpse or a  " tassel " as</p>
      <p> it was called, as a grim warning to those who might wish to press undesirable</p>
      <p> claims, or be' otherwise unduly inconvenient.</p>
      <p> On  the igth  March,   1478, Thomas Portuis of the Halkshawis (Hawk-acta ILor&amp;e</p>
      <p> .   au&amp;ttore p. 81.</p>
      <p> shaw in  Tweedsmuir)   obtained  a judgment  on  behalf of himself and the</p>
      <p> widow  and  children of the  late  Hubert Portuis, his brother, against Walter</p>
      <p> Tweedie of Drummelzier, but  whether  it  was ever actually paid we do not</p>
      <p> know.    On  the same day Walter Tweedie,  who appears  to have been  in a</p>
      <p> good deal of trouble,   had a difficulty with  Henry and John Preston in</p>
      <p> regard to the marriage of Thomas Somerville, lately deceased,  with Walter's</p>
      <p> daughter,  whose name  is  not  given,   but whose dowry apparently  had not acta Zor&amp;a</p>
      <p> been paid over by her father.     Perhaps Walter was annoyed at the death</p>

      <p> of his son-in-law, and at finding his daughter on his hands again. After the manner of the times, however, the matter was adjourned, and we hear no more of it.</p>
      <p> In the same year, on the nth June, there is a record of a curious dispute between this Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier and " Master Adam of Cokburne of Skraling " about " a futit Cop of Silver with a covertour of the samyn double gilt," which Adam claimed from Walter. This question was also adjourned, with the curious direction that Walter should call witnesses "gif it pies hym," and as is dryly added, " gif he has ony." Whether Adam ever got the cup, history does not relate, but as Walter Tweedie had possession of it, and his death did not take place until many years after, we may have our own views of what the probable ending was.</p>
      <p> On the 18th September, 1478, the half of the lands of Halmyr and the Camys were confirmed to Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier, who in the following year comes into conflict with his powerful neighbours, the Hays of Yester, in regard to a claim made by them upon him and Alexander Hors-bruk of that Ilk, as sureties for Gilbert Cokburne of the Glen. In this matter, which was heard on the 13th March, 1479, before the Lords Auditors, Tweedie pursued his old tactics of an adjournment, but without the same success, for it was heard again on the  11th  October, though curiously enough the record is silent as to the result.</p>
      <p> On the 14th February, 1480-81, Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier served on the Inquisition which declared deliverance in the Justice Air of Peebles.</p>
      <p> "Master" William Tweedie, Dean of Peebles, applied on the 15th February, 1480, for a license for Sir William Gibson, the Chaplain of the Rood Altar, to enable the latter to travel for four years, and the license was given by the award of the whole Court. The same ecclesiastic, referred to as "Master Wylyam of Twede, person (parson), of Glengwham, and deyn (dean) of Peblis in that tym," is mentioned in the Peebles Burgh Records under date 23rd of July, 1480, when Herbert Tweedie and others "with consent of the hayll communite of the said burgh (Peebles), passit to the markat cors of the samyn, haf gewyn herytable stat sesing  and possession</p>
      <p>  to Sir Wylyam  Thomson,   Chaplin,   and to his successors</p>
      <p> that sail Sing mes and mak service at the Rud altar in Sant Androis</p>
      <p> Kyrk of Peblis,   in the Rud loft for evirmar  to  pray for</p>
      <p> the sawll of the said Sir Wylyam Thomson, his fader's sawll and his moder's sawll, and for the prosperite and the wellfar of the burgh of Peblis."</p>
      <p> In the Register of the Great Seal, in a Charter of James III., under date of 8th May, 1481, Margaret Tweedie is again referred to as the wife of Andrew Ker of Cessford.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-21"/>
      <p> Herbert Tweedie again comes before us, in  1482, as an alleged wrong- S3* 1482. doer,   with others,  in proceedings taken by Johne 01 Gledstanys ot  that ^uMtocs p.  98. Ilk and others, in regard to the wrongful occupation of the  Common of Cademuir and  Common  Struther,  as to which the  Lords  Auditors direct an Inquisition to be chosen by the next Justice Air at  Peebles,   the date of this Act being 26th March,   14S2.     The matter seems to have been of  sufficient importance to cause King  James  V. to  issue Letters dated at Edinburgh,  6th February,   1484-85,   directed to the Justices  on the South side of  the Forth to make  further inquisition,   whereof the deliverance or judgment is given on the 18th of the same month against Johne of Gled-stanis,  the  finding being  that  the  Common  of  Cademuir and the  Common (Peebles SBurgb Struther  belong to  the  Burgh  of  Peebles,    whose interests  apparently  2 g  C ° V 6 PP '     ' Herbert Tweedie was upholding.</p>
      <p> A complaint  is made,   in 1483, by one Henry Preston against  Gilbert a.2&gt;. t483. Tweedie for the  latter  having carried  off '' eighty ewes, a  horse, and  a pair auditors p. 117. of brigantynis,"   and Gilbert  is  summoned,  but whether he ever appeared we do not learn—probably not.</p>
      <p> Laurence Tweedie was sub-prior of  Melrose Abbey about this  time, S.H&gt;. 1484.</p>
      <p> for,  on  the  24th April,   1484,  he  made a grant in his official capacity  as</p>
      <p> such to  David Scott  of  Branxholme of the bailliary  of the  lands of Esdale. HMetors of</p>
      <p> It  is  somewhat  reassuring  to  find  that  the family counted among its ** ^    * 5 %</p>
      <p> members both the Dean of Peebles and the sub-prior of Melrose, and it is to</p>
      <p> be hoped that the influence of these divines was exerted in a proper direction.</p>
      <p> Alexander Tweedie  and John  Tweedie are found as  witnesses to ^eg. (St. Seal</p>
      <p> ,   PP- 337, 349.</p>
      <p> charters in the years 1484 and i486,   in one  of  which the unusual name  b.d.  1486.</p>
      <p> of Yhoile appears as a surname.</p>
      <p> An  entry in the Acts of  Parliament for the year 1487 shows that the H.2). 1487. Laird of Drummelzier was  in  some trouble,  for the King  issued  a precept  vol&gt;   ((   p jg^ on the  15th  October  calling upon  all Prelates,   Bishops,  Abbots,  Earls,  and Parsons,  to attend in  Edinburgh to advise  the King upon certain  matters, among others " the pcess of forfatn of ye lard of  Drumelzor and Edward Huntr, etc."</p>
      <p> Trouble arose shortly after with Thomas  Porteous of  Hawkshaw, who S.2). 1489. was arraigned on  16th  February,   1489,  for having,  no doubt by  way of auoftors p, 137, reprisal  for some injury,  lifted seventy-four lambs from the lands of Oliver Castle, belonging to William Tweedie and Laurence  Tweedie.</p>
      <p> On the 16th April in the same year King James IV.   confirmed a IReg. ©t. Seal charter by Christian Dikyson, the wife of " Walter Tweedie of Drummelzier," and  one of the heirs of John  Dikyson of Smithfield, in favour of Elizabeth her daughter, of lands called the Denys.</p>
      <p> Something of the state of  the Lowlands and the  Borders at  this time may be  gathered from  the legislation of the period.      We may be sure</p>
      <p> c *</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-22"/>
      <p> that if it had come to having to deal with the troubles by Act of Parliament, things must have been very bad indeed. Personal conflicts, raids and slaughters, no doubt, were matters of every-day life, long before they attracted such attention as that of the King and Parliament, and it would need a graphic pen to give any adequate description of the daily scenes of those times.</p>
      <p> The internecine strife of the powerful families of the  Borders however</p>
      <p> at length  engaged the attention of  Parliament.    In the year 1428 a Statute</p>
      <p> had ordained  " that  na man suld ridande na gangande cum to na Courte</p>
      <p> Scot vol ti na  Semblay  with multitude of  folkys  na  with armys."      The matter again</p>
      <p> P-122.   came before Parliament in 1478,  and in the accounts of the Lord High</p>
      <p> a.2&gt;. 1401.   .   r •</p>
      <p> Cbron.  &amp; flhem.     Treasurer is found  under date the 6th of August,   1491, an  item:   "to pass</p>

      <p> vol. (. p. ISO.        Hawkshawis,  to gar them  cess a gadering."</p>
      <p> Trouble seems still  to have been on  foot between the Hays and the</p>
      <p> Tweedies,   for on the 6th  May,   1491, John Tweedie,  of Drummelzier,   is</p>
      <p> called  upon by the  Lords Auditors to pay over the sum of ^96 8s.  claimed</p>
      <p> actsXoros of him by Christian, the widow of  the late Thomas  Hay, the sheriff depute</p>
      <p> of Peebles, and penalties are ordained on him in default.     In the statistical</p>

      <p> Scotland p. 922.    , .   .   ....   r      T ,   .      . ..   .   ..   ,    ,</p>

      <p> Tweedie, " brother to umquhile  (i.e.  the late) the Lord of Drummelzare," for another sum of money, apparently a balance due by him to the same lady, but it is recorded that William Tweedie was " oft tymes callit and nocht comperit," an easy way of dealing with such demands when the authorities who make them have not the power of enforcing their judgments, as was only too often the case on the  Borders in those  days.</p>
      <p> a.H&gt;. 1492.   Not content with  troubles abroad the Tweedies are found  in the next</p>
      <p> year quarrelling amongst themselves. On the 4th February, 1492, the Lords of Council found " for ocht that they have yet sene, Johne Tweedy of Drummelzare dois wrang in the vexacioun and distroubling of James Tweedy, his brother, and his tenentis "   in the peaceable possession and cultivation of</p>
      <p> Seta Somlnoram the lands of Home Huntaris land.     He was ordered to desist, James having V  272</p>
      <p> produced a charter from the late James Tweedie of Drummelzier ; and was</p>
      <p> also directed to restore a " herezeld ox " which he had taken from the lands</p>
      <p> in question. XeOger anorew In the Ledger of Andrew Halyburton reference is made,   under the</p>
      <p> p. iju,   dates  1492-1503, to certain members of the family of  Tweedie having been</p>
      <p> trading correspondents or customers of  his,    but it is added that not much</p>
      <p> is known of them individually.</p>

      <p> The name of  John Tweedie occurs constantly in the records of  the</p>
      <p> Register of the Great Seal during this period as a witness, but who he was</p>

      <p> Tweedie had right as well as might on  his side, or he would  not have</p>
      <p> gone boldly to Edinburgh for a pardon.</p>
      <p> In 1495 there is mention  in  the Ledger  of Andrew Halyburton of Xeoger anorew another dealing  with " John of  Tuedy," whose wife's name  apparently was '</p>
      <p> Margaret.</p>
      <p> In November of the same year  a complaint  was lodged by George Beta. ©om. Edwardsoun, a burgess of  Edinburgh, before the Lords of Council, against  p , 413,' John Tweedie of  Dreva, because the latter had put him to much trouble by commencing  an action against  him and then not appearing to prosecute it.    On  the  13th of the  same month a John Tweedie  accepted office as an 3^0* P. 429. arbitrator to  settle a dispute  between certain persons.    This arbitration  was to be held  at  St.   Giles's  Kirk,   and  if  this be  the same  John Tweedie of whom George Edwardsoun complained, it would seem that Tweedie had more confidence in his own dispensing of justice  than in  that of  the Lords of Council.</p>

      <p> apparently foreign to the nature of these Border lairds that it would almost seem as if the delinquents on this occasion had ascertained previously that merely a nominal penalty in the shape of a small fine would be imposed.</p>
      <p> This incident brings us to the close of the 15th Century, and full though its records are of feuds, slaughters, and forays, we cannot but feel that they really tell us only  little  of what actually went on ; we are left to picture for ourselves the lawlessness and disorder that prevailed in the Lowlands and on the Borders of Scotland in those days with the ever-present danger from the English across the Border and the deadliest feuds existing between the nearest neighbours, and it is indeed almost impossible to realise the state of constant alarm and watchfulness in which the entire population must have spent their lives.</p>

      <p> CHAPTER III.</p>
      <p> A.D.  1500.</p>
      <p> IT would seem as if we chronicled nothing but the misdeeds of the family, but the truth is that the only available records are those of the crimes of the period, and hence the character which pervades the story.     It  is,  indeed,  an illustration of:—</p>
      <p> " The evil that men do lives after them ; The good is oft interred with their bones."</p>
      <p> and so we will hope it was with the Tweedies, and putting the most charitable construction on the matter, let us trust that their unrecorded good deeds at least equalled the evil doings, of which we find so continuous a history.</p>
      <p> On  the 4th  February,    1502,    Gilbert   Tweedie  and  others were  b.D.  1502. arraigned for the slaughter of Edward  Hunter of Polmood.     John Tweedie *«weor*Ieminfl of  Drummelzier,    Walter  Tweedie of  Hawmyre,    and  William  Tweedie P. 207. became sureties  for the appearance of  Gilbert Tweedie  at the next  Justice Aire at  Peebles,  under a considerable penalty ; but what the outcome of  it all was we do not know.</p>
      <p> On  the 15th May,   1505,  the lands of Clifton,  in  Roxburghshire,  were H.2). 1505. confirmed to  James Tweedie,   son and apparent heir  to  John Tweedie of  i^^L-js^ Drummelzier.      These   lands are stated  to  have  been  mortgaged  by P« 60&amp; -Walter Tweedie  of Drummelzier,  and redeemed by  this  James Tweedie, his  son.</p>
      <p> Amongst  the original   Drummelzier  writs,    we  find  a  receipt  by a,©, 1507.</p>
      <p> Patrick,    Earl  of  Bothwell,   to  John  Tweedie of  Drummelzier,    dated ©rifltnal Cbartera</p>

      <p> It  is curious,   remembering the slaughter  of  Edward   Hunter  of</p>
      <p> Polmood by  the  Tweedies  in  1502,   that in   151  1 the  Horne-Huntaris</p>
      <p> Lands in the Barony of  Innerleithen,   which belonged originally to the a.©. 1511.</p>
      <p> Hunter family,   were  granted by James  IV.   to John Tweedie,   who  is  \/mJ.\5\*</p>
      <p> described  in the Charter as " the  Lord of Thanes  (Tinnies)   Castle,   in P. 768.</p>

      <p> engaged in hunting in the lands of Kingis-Halls-Wallis." Polmood, the residence of the Hunters, being held of a subject superior, the Charters did not enter the Great Seal Register, and consequently the opportunity is lost of tracing the originating germ of the fanciful Charter quoted by Pennecuik, under which Malcolm Canmore is represented as granting the lands to an ancestral Hunter. Interesting particulars as to the Hunters of Polmood and their estate, and also a view of Willie Wastle's abode, " the spot they ca'd Linkumdoddie," will be found in Chambers's history of Peeblesshire.</p>
      <p> In the year 1512, John Tweedie of Drummelzier, Richard Brown of Coultermains, and James Lockhart of Lee, became sureties for John Symintoun of Symintoun, who was arraigned on a charge of treason for forging false money, and as Symintoun did not appear, they were "amerceated in the sum of  1,000 merkes."</p>
      <p> In the year 1513, Walter Tweedie was appointed to the office of Parish Clerkship of the church of Stobo, vacant by the death of Thomas Tweedie. It is on record that Walter was distinguished for his clerical character, and was otherwise considered to be suitable for the appointment from both a spiritual and temporal point of view.</p>
      <p> In the same year, John Tweedie is mentioned in a footnote to the Charter granted at Edinburgh on the  17th  August, as being the owner of  lands adjoining  those  mentioned  in the  Charter.</p>
      <p> This year of 1513 was that of the fatal battle of Flodden, and seeing the intimate relations which the Tweedies had with the other, powerful Barons of the district, it is not surprising that a long gap takes place before we hear very much more of them. No doubt most of them and their available followers fell with many others of the flower of Scotland in that  fight.</p>
      <p> " Christiane of Tweedies" apparently gave consent to an arrangement under which James Noble was made tenant of " Ane Ox Gang Land,"  in  Stobo,  on the 12th April,   1522,</p>
      <p> John Tweedie appears as witness to a Charter on the 4th September, 1523,  to William  Elphinstoun, a  Burgess of Edinburgh.</p>
      <p> The year 1524 brings us to the story of the feud between the Tweedies and the Flemings. The cause is not very accurately known, but it seems to have arisen over the disposal in marriage of Catherine Fraser, the heiress of Fruid, in Tweedsmuir. Catherine was a descendant of the old family that had held large estates in the upper part of Tweeddale for many years, and was connected with the Flemings by the marriage of Patrick Fleming of Biggar with one of the heiresses of Sir Simon Fraser in the 12th or 13th century. The Flemings, with their connections the Hays of  Yester,   claimed some control or superiority over the lands of</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-27"/>
      <p> Fruid;   while it will  no doubt be remembered that one of the granddaughters of this Sir Simon Fraser had  married a  Tweedie.</p>
      <p> John, Lord Fleming, desired Catherine to marry Malcolm, not his heir of that name, but another and probably an illegitimate son ; and indeed, it is doubtful whether she had not been actually married to him. If so, it had been done by stealth. The Tweedies, on the other hand, were determined that she should marry James Tweedie, the nephew of John Tweedie of Drummelzier. Ascertaining that Lord Fleming, accompanied by his heir Malcolm and a small retinue of domestics, intended to go hawking over his lands near Drummelzier, about forty or fifty of the ,« r j a ( na i Qhartera Tweedies assembled and waylaid the hunting party among the hills. A of tbe ttwceole hot altercation ensued, ending in a fight, in the course of which Thomas Tweedie of  Drummelzier slew Lord  Fleming.</p>
      <p> Miss Agnes Strickland,   in her  *' Lives  of the Queens of  Scotland,"</p>
      <p> says that it was " Douglas, Lord of Drummelzier," who attacked and murdered .g}( aaar ano tbe</p>
      <p> Lord  Fleming,   and that this was done on the threshold of St.    Giles' Ibouae of fflemlnfl ,     .       t-  1 •   ,   1 •   r pp.300,301,302,</p>

      <p> Wigton Charter Register,   nor  the assertions of  the  old historians.     Not  a</p>
      <p> word  is said in  any  of these  authorities which in  any way implicates  any</p>
      <p> Douglas  in  this  transaction,  nor  was a  Douglas  the  Lord of  Drummelzier,</p>

      <p> The Tweedies carried  off young Malcolm,   now Lord Fleming,  and</p>
      <p> kept  him  in confinement  at  the " Place  of  Drummelzier"   until  they</p>
      <p> extorted  from  him a  promise  to confer  on  them  the  ward and marriage ofGbambcra'</p>

      <p> young Lord  Fleming's brother and some other persons were given into</p>
      <p> the custody of the Tweedies,    and  were  for some  time prisoners  at</p>
      <p> Drummelzier.    On regaining  his liberty,   Fleming sent Catherine Fraser to</p>
      <p> Drummelzier with  her title deeds,   but,   being  anxious to recede from his</p>
      <p> promise, put  it on record that he did  so solely for the purpose of obtaining  J*^tar PClenw</p>
      <p> the release of  his friends, and from  a  dread of  the vindictive character  of</p>
      <p> the Tweedies.</p>
      <p> Other legal instruments,   still preserved,   assert that Catherine had</p>
      <p> gone to  Drummelzier against  her  inclination, and solely for the purpose of</p>
      <p> liberating  the prisoners,  and that whatever she might say  or do on that</p>
      <p> occasion could not legally be  used to the  prejudice  of  herself,  her  estates,</p>
      <p> or her marriage.    These documents are dated the  17th  and 25th November,</p>
      <p> i5 2 4-</p>
      <p> The Civil Authorities lost  no  great time in  making efforts to bring the Tweedies and their  accomplices  to justice.      In  the course of fourteen</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-28"/>
      <p> days after the death of Lord Fleming, it appears that a number of them had been seized or bound down to " thole an assize," for at that time a respite of one year was granted to James Tweedie, the nephew of John Tweedie of Drummelzier, and other persons for the '' cruel slaughter" of Lord John Fleming, and the treasonable taking and preserving of Malcolm, the Master of Fleming, his son, and for the " reif of certain gudis  fro yame  and  yer seruandis  ye  samyn  tyme."</p>
      <p> From an indenture made at Edinburgh on the 23rd November, 1524, and still preserved, it appears that by some influence or other it was arranged between Malcolm Lord Fleming and James, the nephew of John Tweedie of Drummelzier, " that a reconciliation shall take place and all previous wrongs shall be forgiven." This document intimates . that James Tweedie and his men went to the market cross of Peebles "in their lynning claithes,  viz.,  sark alane," and there offered their naked swords to Malcolm Fleming, his  kin  and friends ; bound themselves to be his servants and gave him a bond of man-rent. Whereupon, Lord Fleming, on the part of himself and friends, received James Tweedie and his men " in their faithful troth and kindness," and forgave them the injury which they had inflicted, and, in token of his sincerity, extended to them the right hand of fellowship, and agreed to support and defend them in all their actions lawful  and honest.</p>
      <p> Tweedie and his followers agreed to make the three great pilgrimages of Scotland, namely : St. Ninian's in Galloway, St. Duthus in Ross, and St. Andrew's in Fife, at each of these places to make offering and call mass to be said for the welfare of Lord Fleming's soul; and they were to infeft a Chaplain to say mass at the high altar of Biggar Kirk for the same purpose. It was finally agreed that James Tweedie, the nephew of Walter Tweedie, should be married to one of Lord Fleming's sisters, and that an honest and competent livelihood should, at the sight of friends, be bestowed on the young couple by Tweedie, and that Tweedie was also to receive the  ward and marriage of  the heiress of  Fruid.</p>
      <p> It appears from several documents  still  extant that the terms of this agreement were not strictly adhered to, and that the vengeance of the law ®.2&gt;. 1525.   still pursued the Tweedies and their followers, for in 1525 the lands of</p>
      <p> Easter Drummelzier, with the Place of Tinnes, Hopcalzie, and others belonging to John Tweedie of Drummelzier, and of Wester Drummelzier with the Places thereto belonging to James Tweedie of Glenbrak, and others belonging to both father and son, were all confirmed to Lord Fleming by a •R.(5 : S. 1513—46 Crown Charter, dated 12th August, but were declared to be redeemable by the Tweedies within seven years on payment of certain fixed sums. The writs whereby the Tweedies were reinstated do not occur in the Register ; but that  such  restitution  took  place is shewn by the fact  that  they</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-29"/>
      <p> subsequently  dealt with and occupied  the properties as their own ;   while amongst the  original documents of the  family is a decree of the Lords of Council,   dated 27th September,   1526,   at the instance of Malcolm Lord Fleming, against  John Tweedie of  Drummelzier and others for delivery of ©rig. ftwee&amp;le the  lands  and fortalice  of Drummelzier,   which it would seem must have  Q^^exe been successfully resisted.</p>
      <p> On the 6th June in the following year, however, a respite was granted for nineteen years for James Tweedie of  Drummelzier,   James Tweedie of Kirkhal, and twelve others, for the crime of murdering Lord Fleming.    On the 18th August a petition in connection with this transaction was presented "Register privg to the Lords of  Council by George Geddes of Kirkurd,   by which one  an j&gt;  \qx^  ^ufluat William Tweedie states himself to be a scholar, that he had nothing what- * 527, ever to do with the  slaughter  of  Lord Fleming, and that at the time the crime  was  committed he was in the school  in Edinburgh.     The petition was admitted and the name of William Tweedie was erased  from the Books of Adjournal.</p>
      <p> From the Register  of the Great Seal it would  appear,  under  an 1R.©.S. entry of the 10th November,  1527, that  a  Janet Tweedie was the  wife ofp,n6. George Ross of Hanyng at this time.</p>
      <p> Amongst the manuscripts of the Earl of Home is to be found a B.5). 1528. contract dated  the 9th October,   1528, under which King James V. undertook to grant a release to Lord  Home, his kin, and friends dependent upon Ibtst. /BSSS. him, for all crimes bigane ; the Tweedies and all others who had been at the |p t 8 » Yso. slaughter of the late Lord Fleming being especially exempted from this pardon.</p>
      <p> On the 22nd October, 1528, the Tweedies were declared to be fugitives from the law, and were put to the horn, and their lands forfeited and conferred as a gift upon  Malcolm  Lord  Fleming.</p>
      <p> In the spring of 1529 the case was still unsettled, as it appears that S^®-1529. at that time John Tweedie of Drummelzier, John Tweedie dwelling with him, Thomas Tweedie of Oliver Castle, James Tweedie of Kilbucho, and James Tweedie of Wrae, were compelled to find security to appear at Peebles and answer for their part in the cruel slaughter of John Lord Fleming, John Hay of Yester going security for their appearance. With them were also summoned James Tweedie of Drummelzier, and ten others, who offered Sir Walter Scott, of Branxholme, as their cautioner to answer at the same time and place for the above crime.</p>
      <p> On the 18th September, the King's Messenger-at-Arms had been despatched with the King's writings to summon an assize to convene at Peebles on the 13th day of October, betwixt the Laird of Drummelzier and John Fleming of Biggar. This assize, however, did not give a deliverance on the merits of the slaughter and disputes, but referred the whole case for arbitration by the  Lords of  Council.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-30"/>
      <p> On the 2nd March,  1529, we find John Tweedie of  Drummelzier as one c ™* fgQ  l5l3— * 6  and on the 7th December in the same year a reference to Tweedie is</p>
      <p> •foist. dftSS.</p>
      <p> p. 537.   one of the witnesses to a precept issued by George, the Bishop of Dunkeld,</p>
      <p> is found in the Register of the Great Seal in connection with matters relating to the Barony of  Stenhouse in the County of  Lanark.</p>
      <p> S.S&gt;. 1530.   On  the 4th  March,   1530,  the  whole matter of  the slaughter of Lord</p>
      <p> Fleming at last  came  up  before  the  Lords  of  Council,     when  they</p>
      <p> pronounced a decree  by which John  Tweedie  of  Drummelzier was ordered</p>
      <p> IRegtster prlve  to found a Chaplainry in  the church of Biggar, and to endow it with Council.   1 . .</p>
      <p> a  yearly stipend to make provision  for prayers for the soul of the late</p>
      <p> John Lord Fleming. It was further ordained that James Tweedie, heir-apparent of Drummelzier, and the other chief persons concerned in the slaughter of Lord Fleming should go out of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England within three months and remain abroad three years, or during His Majesty's pleasure, and that the parties in dispute should, in the presence of the King's Council, take each other by the hands and bind themselves for the orderly behaviour of themselves, their kin and followers. S.2). 1531.   This decree  was confirmed by James V.  on the 22nd March,   1531,</p>
      <p> and the  marriage of  Catherine  Fraser to James Tweedie  was part of  the</p>
      <p> "Reg. &lt;Bt. Seal     bargain, and  the King also, in this same year,  granted a charter of  the 1513-46 p. 236.   f „ 5 ,      . '   u t t      j-        u</p>
      <p> lands 01 rruiu to Catherine rraser   and her spouse James I weedie, the</p>
      <p> nephew (nepos) of John Tweedie of Drummelzier."    All this shows that the</p>
      <p> Tweedies gained their point with the full sanction of  the  King and the</p>
      <p> Lords of Council, and we are tempted to think that perhaps after all they</p>
      <p> had been as  much sinned against  as sinning.    Young James Tweedie and</p>
      <p> Catherine Fraser were possibly in love with  and pledged to each other</p>
      <p> from the first, and  Tweedie had determined to marry her in spite of  Lord</p>
      <p> Fleming's declared intention of providing for his illegitimate son by a</p>
      <p> marriage  with  the heiress.</p>
      <p> Under such circumstances one need not wonder at the hot words and the personal conflict which ended in the death of Lord Fleming, or at the persistence of young Tweedie in his purpose, which he eventually gained, of marrying his love. And it may not be unreasonable to surmise that, whilst the Lords of Council could not overlook the killing of Lord Fleming, in which the Tweedies were undoubtedly wrong, yet they took into account the provocation that had been given and recognised the rights of the Tweedies in the quarrel, or they would never have countenanced, much  less  sanctioned,  the marriage of the young couple.</p>
      <p> It must have probably been about this period that the event took place which has been the subject of a curious tradition in Tweeddale. For many years a small property known as Duckpool was held by  a family of the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-31"/>
      <p> name of  Bertram.    Its extent was no more than a Scottish acre, and the</p>
      <p> origin of the ownership was  accounted  for in the following legend:—</p>
      <p> " King James V., who occasionally during  the hunting season spent a</p>
      <p> few days at Polmood,   and who was  also somewhat  fond of  masquerading</p>
      <p> amongst his subjects in humble  guise, was, one day, returning either from</p>
      <p> hunting  or some  other expedition in disguise, when he came upon an old B*e Gockburns &amp;   l .   .   .......        of tbatjlhp.207.</p>
      <p> man named  Bertram, who was tending his cows and amusing himself with a</p>
      <p> tune on the bagpipe.    The monarch accepted an invitation to the cottage of ot  g^otlano '    '</p>
      <p> his new acquaintance and was there entertained hospitably, but with homely vol. (if. p.  86.</p>
      <p> fare, by Bertram and  his  wife.    In the  morning the King disclosed to his Galebonfa bg</p>
      <p> host who he was, and  promised him a grant of  lands in view of his  house, „  q\q,</p>
      <p> with a pool in the centre,  in memory of the tunes played on  the bagpipe</p>
      <p> the  evening  before, and as much ground  at the foot of  Holmes Water as</p>
      <p> would keep  a mare and foal, with a brood sow and nine pigs, with a free</p>
      <p> passage for them to and from his house.    They were to be driven at no higher</p>
      <p> rate 'than a woman  could  walk knitting a sock or spinning with a distaff,'</p>
      <p> and Bertram was also to have five ' soums' of sheep on Holmes Common.</p>
      <p> " Thereafter the  King, accompanied by  Bertram, who had offered to be</p>
      <p> his guide, set forth on  his journey,  in the course  of which  he soon came,</p>
      <p> as some say,   to the Castle  of Drummelzier,   and others,  that of  Tinnies,</p>
      <p> but in any event, one of the strongholds of the head of the Tweedie family,</p>
      <p> a Chieftain who was in the habit of exacting homage and levying tribute</p>
      <p> from all passers by.    The  King and  Bertram passed by without yielding the</p>
      <p> accustomed homage, when  Tweedie, who had ever at his call men-at-arms</p>
      <p> and horses ready,  immediately pursued and fell  upon  them  with his armed</p>
      <p> followers.    The  King, however, taking a bugle from his side, sounded it, and</p>
      <p> in  the course of a few minutes twenty-four belted knights with their</p>
      <p> retainers appeared to his assistance.     The King revealed himself,   to the</p>
      <p> discomfiture of the borderers,   and demanded from Tweedie the homage</p>
      <p> which even  in the midst  of his fastnesses that  Chieftain could not refuse,</p>
      <p> especially in view of the overwhelming force around him.    Throwing himself</p>
      <p> on his knees he implored the clemency  of  his Sovereign,   from whom he</p>
      <p> received a gracious pardon coupled with a few befitting admonitions, and the</p>
      <p> condition that he should convey to Bertram  an acre of  land in the centre</p>
      <p> of his possessions to  be held  for  ever in memory of the services rendered</p>
      <p> to the  King."</p>
      <p> The fact that the Tweedies exacted homage from all who passed their ftenneculfc</p>
      <p> .   (Twee 00a le</p>
      <p> stronghold is no doubt true, for it is borne witness to by many writers, and as p. 254 &lt;Sc.</p>

      <p> 1531,   to  John Tweedie of  Drummelzier,   under which the latter was to</p>
      <p> surrender  to  Sir Andrew  Brown, Chaplain  of  the Altar in Biggar Church,</p>
      <p> and to his successors, an annual rent of  £10  furth of the Lands and Barony</p>
      <p> of Drummelzier.    This penance was also, no doubt, a further compensation</p>
      <p> by the Tweedies  for  the attack on  Lord  Fleming;    and the ancient</p>
      <p> document tells us that the  annual endowment was provided " to infeft ane</p>

      <p> There would appear to have been some trouble in the town of Peebles</p>
      <p> regarding  the  applications of Sir John Ker and Sir John Tweedie for the</p>
      <p> Chaplainry of the Altar of  St.  Mary the Virgin,  in the church  there, about</p>
      <p> U.W.  1532.   the year 1532.      There was continuous litigation and trouble over this</p>
      <p> JSurgb lRccorfis  matter  for  many  years,  and  Sir John Tweedie  would  appear  to have been</p>
      <p> rejected notwithstanding  that he had  the  support of his  powerful cousins,</p>
      <p> the Tweedies of  Drummelzier, because he was found unlearned in Church</p>
      <p> Song by the greater part of the Council of the Burgh and the Dean and</p>
      <p> Choristers of  the Church,   whilst Sir  John Ker was found fit  not only in</p>
      <p> reading but also in chant.     But it would seem notwithstanding that Sir John</p>
      <p> Tweedie  eventually  carried the day,   and retained the Chaplainry until  a</p>
      <p> few years  after  the Reformation,   when he  resigned in favour of Gilbert</p>
      <p> Tweedie, another Chaplain.</p>
      <p> The records of all these ecclesiastical troubles are of considerable length,</p>
      <p> of Peebles.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-33"/>
      <p> and the curious in such matters are referred to the originals for the details of a remarkable struggle.    King James V. himself seems to have supported Sir John</p>
      <p> Ker, for he wrote a letter dated 6th August, 1532, from Edinburgh to the Bailies ^ oro ' lRecoros of</p>

      <p> and cease from molesting and troubling Sir John Ker in the peacable " joising of</p>
      <p> his said alterage," all of which, however, would appear to have been of no avail.</p>
      <p> On  the 17th December,   1533, we find in the Register of  the Great B.D. 1533. Seal the record that the King  at Coupar confirmed a Charter by which John  Tweedie of  Drummelzier granted the lands of Hopcailzie to his 1R.©.S. 1513—46 grandson, John  Tweedie, the son  of James  Tweedie  and  Agnes  Somerville, the daughter of Hugh Lord  Somerville.</p>
      <p> The rental book of the old  Barony of Stobo tells us that on the 18th B.2&gt;. 1534. June,   1534,   Thomas Russel was the son of Jonat Tweedie,   "his  modyr," and that James Tweedie held four  ox  gangs in the  Hill  House of  Stobo.</p>
      <p> John Tweedie of  Drummelzier throughout all this period appears  at different times as witness to various Charters recorded in the  Registers, and notwithstanding all that had passed, James Tweedie of Drummelzier seems to have been high in the royal favour shortly afterwards, for in the year 1536 we S.2&gt;. 1536. find that he married Marjorie (Mariota), the daughter of Lord Somerville,  ^ peevnae ot sister of  the Queen  herself, and that King James V.   invited himself to the Scotlanb p. 508.</p>

      <p> The names of Walter Tweedie,  John Tweedie,   Henry Tweedie,   and CK. vol. jvff. Margaret Tweedie,  appear in the Exchequer Rolls during the  year 1540 in  reference to the lands of  Fareholme and Glenbeth.</p>
      <p> The rental book of the  old  Barony of Stobo gives,   on the 28th B.B. 1545. January,   1545, an extract shewing that Adam Tweedie dealt  with the four</p>

      <p> The troubles with the  Flemings seem  hardly yet over, for we find in</p>
      <p> the  Acts of  the Parliament  of  Scotland  at  this time,  under date the 3rd</p>
      <p> October,   1545,   a complaint  by Malcolm  Lord Fleming to  the Lords in</p>

      <p> give assurance to  George Douglas and James Tweedie of Drummelzier for</p>
      <p> good behaviour, and that in like manner George Douglas and James Tweedie</p>
      <p> of Drummelzier should have given the same to him, but had not done so;  and</p>

      <p> In the Register of the Great Seal under the date of the 7th February, 1R.&lt;3.5. 1546—80 1551-52, appears a notice of a Charter granted by the Queen to James  p ' Tweedie of Drummelzier in connection with his marriage with Mariota Stuart, the Queen's own sister, and a certain arrangement with their son John Tweedie, apparently all having reference to some transaction carried out on the 30th August,  1542,  at Drummelzier, of which one John Tweedie of  Innerleithen had been witness.</p>
      <p> The Rental Book of the Old Barony of Stobo contains a reference to a James Tweedie as the son of the late Andrew Tweedie, under date of the 6th July, 1553, whereby he was confirmed in " Twa oxen gang" of land in Stobo called  Nether  Hillhouse, vacant by the decease of his father.</p>

      <p> Some time  prior to  this date a member  of the  Drummelzier family,</p>

      <p> also  with the  Nasmyths of  Posso ;   we find  numerous references to it within</p>
      <p> the  next fifty  years,  and there  is  no doubt that  there was much trouble</p>

      <p> James Tweedie of Drummelzier,   his brother  german,  in the lands of  the</p>
      <p> Barony  of  Drummelzier on  the 21st October  in  the same year.</p>
      <p> In  December,   1562, James  Tweedie of  Fruid,  most  likely  the  son  of 2UD.t562. the  individual  who had  married Catherine Fraser formerly  referred to, was attacked when seated before the fire in the house of William Tweedie, Burgess  of  Edinburgh,  and  mortally  wounded  before he could raise himself up or parry the blows aimed at him.      Patrick Hunter, John  Hunter, John 3Bl9flar an&amp; tbc Burn, George Patterson and William Glen were tried for this murder, and  p . 357, they were all acquitted.</p>
      <p> In the Borough records of  Peebles,   under date 23rd  June,   1563,  is S.2J.1563. found a description of  the opening of an old chest, or almery, at the Castle of  Neidpath, which was found to contain  "ane  posset cop with ane fute of the selfe  of esche ane  littill  bikker callit ane salt fat with ane fute of esche Peebles JBurgb ane lame can and thre paperis of armes of umquhill Archibald Erie of Argus  1Rccor£l0 p * 288 ' and na utheris thingis."    This was done in the presence of a  Notary  Public, William  Lord Hay of  Yester,  and others, amongst  whom  we  find  William Tweedie of  Drummelzier;   but for what purpose the opening was made in so formal a manner does not appear, except that the  Lady of  Yester seems to have laid claim  to  the  chest.     Robert Walker, a carpenter, was the man employed to open  it, and there is another note that  Robert Walker was also caused to  open another chest, called " a Stule Almery," which  had nothing therein except worm-webs.</p>
      <p> Adam  Tweedie of Drava would appear to have been a man of violent S.2D. 1565. and ungovernable temper.    There is reference, amongst others of his misdeeds Criminal trials on record,  to  one under date 25th January,   1565,   in  a complaint against vol. t. p. 475. him in that he had committed the crime of " cutting off  Robert Rammage's luggis (ears)   and dismembering him thereof."    The  crime was not  denied,</p>
      <p> ™ #</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-38"/>
      <p> but Adam Tweedie pleaded the King's and Queen's remission, 30th November, 1565,   and he was  accordingly absolved, William Tweedie  of  Drummelzier engaging to satisfy the Rammages, who,  in all probability,  never received any sort of redress. ■R. fl&gt;rfv.

      <p> story with  which  everyone  who  knows anything 01 the history 01 Scotland</p>
      <p> is well acquainted.    It does not surprise us to find that two of the Tweedies</p>
      <p> were  concerned in this crime  and were  amongst the  body of armed men</p>
      <p> who, headed by Darnley, Morton,  Ruthven, and others, on the night of the</p>
      <p> 9th March,  1566, rushed into the Palace  at Holyrood and in the Queen's</p>
      <p> presence assassinated  David  Rizzio,   her foreign Secretary and favourite</p>
      <p> musician.    This outrage naturally caused great terror in the  Palace.    The</p>
      <p> attendants on the Queen were quite taken by surprise,   and on finding</p>
      <p> themselves utterly unable to contend against the attacking force they escaped</p>
      <p> by the back windows and some of them did not stop till they reached  the</p>
      <p> Castle  of  Crichton.    William Tweedie of  Drummelzier and Adam Tweedie</p>
      <p> of Drava, of whom we have heard before, were implicated in this conspiracy,</p>
      <p> and  along with the other conspirators were summoned on the  19th March</p>
      <p> following to appear personally before  the King and Queen and  the Lords</p>
      <p> of the Secret Council to  answer for the crime;   the Register of the Privy</p>
      <p> Council being headed as " in the  Reign of Henry and Mary."    It is curious,</p>
      <p> however,   that their names,   although appearing in the summons,   do not</p>
      <p> figure in the list of  those who  were put to the horn and to escheat  for</p>
      <p> their participation in the outrage.      The Register of the Privy Council,</p>
      <p> however,  gives their names as amongst those who were " dilatid of the</p>
      <p> slauchter of  David Riccio," and denounces them as rebels.</p>
      <p> mtU'3  XanDco There is a statement in  Burke's Landed Gentry that William Tweedie</p>
      <p> (Bentrg vol. It.   J</p>
      <p> p. 1866.   of Oliver Castle had a "feu Charter" dated  nth December,  1565, of the</p>
      <p> lands of  Oliver,  but  the source whence  Burke obtained this information is</p>
      <p> not  given.</p>
      <p> In the records of ministers and exhorters with their stipends, in  1567,</p>
      <p> printed by  the Maitland Club, appears amongst others Walter Tweedie as</p>
      <p> the  exhorter for  Broughton and Dawick at a stipend of  ^"26 13s. 4d. per</p>
      <p> annum ;   while  he  seems  as well  to  have been the reader at  Glenholm and</p>
      <p> Broughton  in 1574,  Kilbucho being also placed under his charge in 1591.</p>
      <p> IR.flJ.C. vol. I.   James Tweedie appears to have owned the supremacy of King James VI.</p>

      <p> Sir Walter Scott has immortalized the story  of  the escape  of  Mary,</p>
      <p> Queen of Scots,  from the Castle of  Loch  Leven.    She was  imprisoned in</p>
      <p> a rude and  inconvenient Tower on a small island where there was scarcely</p>
      <p> room to walk fifty yards, and not even the intercession of Queen Elizabeth</p>

      <p> could procure any  mitigation  of  her captivity.      Sir William Douglas,  the</p>
      <p> Laird of Loch Leven,   discharged with severe fidelity the task of  Mary's</p>
      <p> jailor, but his younger  brother,  George Douglas, overcome  by the  Queen's</p>
      <p> distress and perhaps also by her beauty,   laid a plot for her  deliverance.</p>
      <p> The plot was discovered and he was expelled from the island in consequence, 5 ale tf^?    ,. r ......   ©ranofatber bj&gt;</p>
      <p> but  he kept  up a correspondence with a kinsman,  William Douglas, called Sir inn. Scott.</p>
      <p> Little Douglas,  who had relations in the Castle.     On  Sunday, the 2nd  May,</p>
      <p> 1568, this William contrived to steal the keys of the Castle while the family</p>
      <p> were at supper, and  let  Mary and her attendant out of the Tower when all</p>
      <p> had gone  to rest.      He then locked the  gates of the Castle to  prevent</p>
      <p> pursuit,   placed the Queen and her waiting-maid in a little skiff and rowed</p>
      <p> to the shore, throwing the keys of the Castle into the lake in the course of</p>
      <p> their passage.     Lord Seton and a party of his  adherents  were waiting  at</p>
      <p> the landing place with horses, and the Queen instantly mounted and hurried</p>
      <p> off to Niddrie  Castle in Mid-Lothian,  whence she proceeded next day to</p>
      <p> Hamilton.</p>
      <p> In the narration of this romantic story in " The Abbot," history and tradition are somewhat confused, and the success of the escape is conferred on George Douglas, while the merit of it belongs, in reality, to the boy called William, or Little Douglas, either from his youth or his slight stature. In the novel, the part of this Little Douglas has been assigned to Roland Graeme.</p>
      <p> The news of Mary's escape flew like lightning throughout the country and spread enthusiasm everywhere. The people remembered her gentleness, grace and beauty, and if they reflected on her errors they no doubt thought she had been punished for them with great severity. On Sunday, Mary was a sad and helpless captive in the lonely Tower of Loch Leven; on the Saturday following she was at the head of a powerful confederacy by which nine Earls, nine Bishops, eighteen Barons and many gentlemen of rank engaged to defend her person and restore her to power. Buckingham, in his memoirs of Mary Stuart, says, " No sooner had the captive lady escaped from her prison and raised the banner of loyalty in that secluded part of her kingdom than a band of the brightest and ablest spirits of the nation flocked joyously to her standard, and a Bond of Association was raised in her favour and signed by nearly 150 of the members of Nobility, Clergy and Gentry." It is somewhat curious, having regard to the part played by the dBarg Stuart, family in the only too recent murder of Rizzio, to find the • Tweedies now jg^  vo ?j p'233 concerned on Mary's behalf in this rising; but amongst the Barons is recorded Tweedie of Drummelzier, who was actually one of the signatories to this Bond, which was dated 8th May, 1568, for the defence of the Queen of Scots. It is perhaps not uninteresting to quote from Sir Walter Scott's description of the morning after, Mary's escape, when, describing her feelings</p>

      <p> on awakening, he puts words into her mouth which call the scene vividly before our eyes :—</p>
      <p> " ' Rise, rise, Catherine,' cried the enraptured Princess, ' arise and come hither !—here are swords and spears in true hands and glittering armour on loyal breasts. Here are banners, my girl, floating in the wind as lightly as summer clouds. Great God ! what pleasure to my weary eyes to trace their devices—thine own brave father's—the princely Hamilton's—the faithful Fleming's—See! see ! they have caught a glimpse of me, and throng towards the window.' "</p>
      <p> The account of the battle that followed is as melancholy as the foregoing gathering was enthusiastic. On the 13th May, 1568, the Regent, Murray, occupied the village of Langside, which lay full in the march of the Queen's army, and after a most obstinate encounter, the battle was eventually decided against the Queen, who beheld the final and fatal defeat of her forces from the Castle called Cruikstain, from whence she fled to Galloway, and eventually reaching England, surrendered herself to the mercy of Elizabeth, and to an imprisonment which only ended with her death in  Fotheringay Castle.</p>
      <p> On the 13th September, 1570, the reign being given as that of James VI. in the Public Records, thus marking the fact that the authorities had accepted Mary's flight from Scotland as her abdication, we find an entry stating that James Cockburn of Skraling, William Tweedie of Drum-melzier, and Adam Tweedie of Drava were called upon to make good their Bond given in security of certain persons who did not come forward to answer the charges laid against them ; and on 27th June, 1572, we find amongst the index of names excluded from the text that of Adam Tweedie of  Drava, who had been cited, but for what purpose we do not know.</p>
      <p> In the Records of the Burgh of Peebles we find on the 31st March, 1572, the names of James Tweedie and Thomas Tweedie as Quartermasters of the Watch, and on the 19th May, in the same year, in the Burgh Record of the " vesying of the wappynnis," are mentioned "James Tweedie armit, Gilbert Tweedie armit, Thomas Tweedie armit, and James Tweedie armit," James Tweedie, Gilbert Tweedie and Thomas Tweedie all being again mentioned in the Burgh Records under dates the 28th May, 1572, and the 19th June,   1572, as Members of the Council of the Burgh.</p>
      <p> From some cause unknown, a bad feeling had grown up in the town of Peebles against John Dickyson of Winkstoun, the Provost of the Burgh, and he was at length barbarously murdered on the 5th July, 1572. Of this even the records take no notice except in a casual way, but on the day following the murder, William Dickyson of Winkstoun and his kinsmen promised to live peaceably in time to come, and the baillies and community in like manner undertake not to molest him or his friends ; but though only incidentally referred to at this time and elsewhere in the records, the fact of</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-41"/>
      <p> the slaughter is undoubted, for it was the subject of a judicial enquiry.    On Pttcalrn's</p>
      <p> &amp;   ••it     Criminal trials</p>
      <p> the  19th July in the same year James Tweedie, John Wychtman, Martin Hay vol. t. p.31.</p>
      <p> and John Bullo, all  of  Peebles, and  Thomas Johnstone,  were tried in the</p>
      <p> High Court of Justiciary for the " cruel slaughter of the late John Dickisone</p>
      <p> of  Wynkstone,"  but the assize acquitted them with only one dissentient.</p>
      <p> According to tradition which lingered in the town  till  within very recent</p>
      <p> years, the murder was committed  in the  High Street near  Deane Gutter.</p>
      <p> From  the following we learn that the Tweedies did not disdain  to</p>
      <p> act the part of freebooters when occasion offered.    On the  13th  September,</p>
      <p> 1572,    complaint   was   made   to   the   Privy  Council   at  Stirling   by</p>
      <p> Duncan  Weir  of  Staneburne,    that  William  Tweedie,    with  Roger his 1R.jP-C.vol.lt.</p>

      <p> brother,   his  sons Symon Tweedie and Adam Tweedie, John Tweedie the</p>
      <p> tutor of Drummelzier, and others,  had assaulted the House  of  Staneburne</p>
      <p> and raided it of cattle,   horses and various articles,   amongst which were</p>
      <p> two Jeddart  staves,   a species of battle-axe or partisan called after the</p>
      <p> town of Jedburgh,   the citizens of that town being  distinguished for the</p>
      <p> use of that particular weapon.      William  Tweedie alleged that he had</p>
      <p> obtained a gift of  what he had taken  away,  and,  therefore, had done  no</p>
      <p> wrong to  Duncan Weir.    The Regent and Council referred the  matter to</p>
      <p> the  Lords of the  Cession  " to do justice therein according to the  Laws of</p>
      <p> the Realm,"  and we hear nothing whatever as to whether Duncan Weir</p>
      <p> ever obtained his rights or not, or even whether he had any.</p>
      <p> On the 15th December,   1573,  Sir  Walter Scott of  Branxholme  and H.D. 1573. John Tweedie,   the  tutor of Drummelzier,   entered into  recognisances that J?'?,'?*  v ° l * M * Margaret Turnbull,  the widow of  David  Elliot,  and Walter Scott her son, should answer for certain things laid to their charge,   and should not molest Gawin, or Jean Scott, his wife.</p>
      <p> According  to an entry in the Register of the Great Seal made  at  ir.&lt;s.s.  1546—80 Holyrood  House  on the 8th  February,   1573,   it would appear that one p John Tweedie,  of  what place  is  not mentioned,  had  a  wife  whose  maiden name  had been  Dunsyre; and that shortly  afterwards James  Brown of Logan  made complaint to the  Lord Regent  and the  Lords  of the  Secret Council  in regard to the  securityship  for the entry  of  Walter Henderson, servant to  William Tweedie  of Wrae,   and letters were ordained to  be •R.p.c. vol.

      <p> On the 6th December, 1574, Thomas Cant of Sanct Gillegrange becomes surety for Adam Tweedie of Drava, that he shall appear before the Lord Regent and the Lords of Secret Council in February that is next to come, and abide by such orders as shall be made for the quietness of the country, and also that he, his kin, brothers, servants and friends, and all others with whom he may have anything to do, shall in no way invade or pursue Charles Geddes of Rachan, and James Geddes his father, his brother, his kin and others, except by regular process of law, under bond of ,£2,000, and Adam Tweedie binds himself to relieve Thomas Cant of the bond. This surety by Thomas Cant must either have been insufficient or withdrawn, for on the following day, the 7th December, William Lauder of Halton undertakes the same obligation concerning Tweedie and his relations, while at the same time James Tweedie of Frude, John Tweedie of Drummelzier, and Patrick his uncle, all had to enter into sureties for good behaviour, no doubt, in connection with these  disturbances.</p>
      <p> A Tweedie is mentioned in the Register of the Great Seal under date, 16th February,  1579,  in regard to a certain Charter confirmed by the  King in favour of John  Hamilton of Stanehous.</p>
      <p> In 1579 John Tweedie, the tutor of Drummelzier, seems to have been at daggers-drawn with Sir Alexander Jardine of Apilgirth, for he lodges a complaint against him in that Sir Alexander had forcibly entered in his lands and seized the rents ; and for once in a way, Tweedie appears to have been in the right, for he boldly appeared before the Privy Council and proved his case. Sir Alexander Jardine not having appeared, he was denounced a rebel and put to the horn with its attendant consequences.</p>
      <p> We find that Gilbert Tweedie is mentioned as being in Parliament as the Member and Commissioner for Peebles in the year 1579.</p>
      <p> John Tweedie, the tutor ol Drummelzier, appears among the names of assize on the Register of the Great Seal for the year 1580 at Edinburgh  on  the  13th  May.</p>
      <p> Under the old ecclesiastical system, Dawick was a vicarage dependent on Stobo, but after the Reformation it became an independent parish. The church lands, there under reservation of a glebe, were feued out, and under a Charter granted on the 15th June, 1580, by Robert Douglas, designed as Parish Vicar of Stobo, with consent of the Archbishop, Dean, and Chapter of Glasgow, in favour of John Tweedie, the tutor of Drummelzier, the feu duty payable was fixed at five merkes yearly ; and the grant was confirmed by a Crown Charter dated the 20th  March,   1581-2.</p>
