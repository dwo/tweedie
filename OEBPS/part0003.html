      <p> The earliest mention of any crest or armorial bearing attributable to the</p>
      <p> family is the reference to a  " William de Hopkelioghe, one of the tenants</p>
      <p> of the King in the County of Peebles," who swore fealty to Edward I.</p>
      <p> balm'sCalcnoar 0 f England at Berwick-upon-Tweed on 28th August, 1296. His Seal is</p>
      <p> pp. 202, 583. described as  "Vesica shape lion passant to Sinister," and lettered  " Willelm</p>
      <p> de Hopcailov." Hopkailzie was a very early possession of the Tweedie</p>
      <p> family.</p>
      <p> 3Booft of ffila3ons In Sir David Lyndsay's register the Arms of Tweedie of Drummelzier</p>
      <p> are given as :—" Argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief azure." The</p>
      <p> simplicity of this at once speaks for its antiquity, and this is the coat, with</p>
      <p> various differences, that is found in use amongst all of the name.</p>
      <p> In his well-known work on Scottish Arms, Mr. R. R. Stodart tells us that the Arms of Tweedie are cut in stone at Drummelzier Castle with a "bull's head" as crest and the motto " Thol and think." This has however now disappeared, and it may be doubted whether the crest stoBart Scottish was not a boar's head, which might easily be mistaken for a bull's head arms vol. it in rough sculpture defaced by weather and worn by age ; or it may be that the Drummelzier and Oliver branches of the family adopted different crests for the sake of distinction while in common with all other branches they used the same Coat of Arms. Mr. Stodart goes on to say :—" Mr. Laing described the Seal used in 1511 by John Tweedie of Drummelzier as a saltire couped with a fess (? Chief) charged with a mullet, crest a wolf's head. The Tweedies of Oliver bore the Saltire engrailed, but the Chief is omitted in the stones there where the arms are cut with the dates 1649 and 1734, and the crest is a boar's head couped with the motto "Tholl and think on."</p>
      <p> •foouseor In the history of   "The House of Cockburn" it is also stated that</p>

      <p> The Arms are also emblazoned in the carving over the door at Drummelzier Church, and on the Tweedie tombstone in Peebles Churchyard, to which we shall presently refer.</p>
      <p> Tweedie of Drummelzier was from very early times the dominant head of the sept, but it is doubtful whether the family in Oliver was not actually the elder line, although their rights as such were absorbed by their</p>

      <p> powerful kinsmen, the Tweedies of Drummelzier, for as already mentioned, on the ancient stone at Oliver put up by Patrick Tweedie of Oliver in 1649 and still existing, the "Chief" is apparently wanting and the stone shews only a Saltire with the boar's head as a crest and the motto " Thole and think on," which would almost indicate that Oliver was the senior branch and that Tweedie of Drummelzier had originally sprung from a younger son and assumed the " Chief azure" as a difference. There is at Oliver, as well, a stone with the Arms of James Tweedie of Oliver, his own and his wife's initials, the date 1734, and the motto " Tholl and think on," while at Quarter is to be seen over the door a stone with the same family arms, " Argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief azure," the date 1762, the names of Thomas Tweedie and Mary Stevenson, and the motto   " Tholl and think on."</p>
      <p> Lawrence Tweedie of Oliver had his watch and the family seals stolen late in the eighteenth century. The Tweedies of Oliver always carried the arms as " argent a saltire engrailed gules a chief azure " with the boar's head for a crest, and the motto " Thole and think on," as we have already mentioned.</p>
      <p> On the death of Lawrence Tweedie, Oliver descended to Christian, his only surviving daughter. Her husband, George Stodart (who was as well a first cousin on the Tweedie side), took the name of Tweedie, which had also been that of his mother, in addition to Stodart, and assumed the arms, which the Tweedie-Stodarts still carry as follows  :—</p>
      <p> "Quarterly 1st and 4th counter-quartered, 1st and 4th Argent a fess nebuly between three stars of six points Sable a bordure gules for Stodart Xgon IReglster. 2nd and 3rd Argent a Chefron between three Bulls' heads couped Sable armed Vert for Turnbull, 2nd and 3rd Argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief azure for Tweedie, crest a Boar's head proper with the motto, ' Thole and think on,' " as the same appears on seals still in the possession of Thomas Tweedie-Stodart of Oliver.</p>
      <p> Tweedie of Quarter, a younger branch of Oliver, also carried the family coat, the Boar's head as a crest, and the motto, " Thole and think on," and at a later date Thomas Stevenson Tweedie of Quarter and Rachan, whilst continuing to use the same coat of arms and motto, adopted for a crest, instead of the Boar's head, a demi-lion holding an anchor proper, but for what reason is not known. Neither Drummelzier, Oliver, Quarter, nor any other branch ever appear to have gone through the formality of re-registration in 1672, probably on account of the troublous times through which the family was then passing, nor have younger sons matriculated, or no doubt a mark of cadency in each case would have been added. Captain Michael Tweedie, R.A., a younger son of Alexander Tweedie of Quarter, assumed in right of his wife Frances, the heiress of Richard Walter Forbes of Rawlinson,</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-138"/>
      <p> Rolvenden, Kent (a younger son of Forbes of Watertoun in Aberdeenshire),</p>
      <p> the arms of Forbes on an escutcheon of pretence over the arms of Tweedie,</p>
      <p> and added as a mark of cadency a gun in the chief, adopted no doubt on</p>
      <p> account of his being in the Royal Artillery. His descendant quartered the</p>
      <p> arms of Tweedie and Forbes and matriculated them in Lyon Court as</p>
      <p> follows:—Quarterly 1st and 4th Argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief</p>
      <p> Xgon IRegteter. azure also engrailed the latter charged with a fraise of the first for Tweedie,</p>
      <p> 2nd and 3rd counter-quartered, 1st and 4th azure three Bears' heads couped</p>
      <p> Argent muzzled and langued gules, 2nd and 3rd Argent three Unicorns,</p>
      <p> heads erased Sable for Forbes, crest a boar's head erased proper ; motto,</p>
      <p> 'Thole and think on.'"</p>
      <p> At the time of this matriculation the arms of Tweedie were proved</p>
      <p> back to Thomas Tweedie of Oliver, 1611, and any descendant of his is</p>
      <p> therefore entitled on application to the Lyon Court, and proving his descent,</p>
      <p> to matriculate the arms of Tweedie with a suitable difference ; the differences</p>
      <p> or marks of cadency already added are a " fraise " in the chief, apparently to</p>
      <p> denote the passage of the Coat from the Oliver family to that of Quarter</p>
      <p> (a younger branch) ; and the engrailing of the chief, to designate the younger</p>
      <p> branch formed by the marriage of Captain Michael Tweedie with the heiress</p>
      <p> of Rawlinson, and the new branch thus formed; and no doubt these differences</p>
      <p> or marks of cadency would be followed out suitably by the Lyon Court in</p>
      <p> granting matriculation to any other members of the family who make</p>
      <p> application. This Michael Tweedie, when a Lieutenant of Royal Artillery,</p>
      <p> during the siege of Bayonne, in 1814, crawled in at night between the</p>
      <p> French pickets to reconnoitre, and finding on his return that he had lost</p>
      <p> his seals from his fob chain he bethought himself of the place where the</p>
      <p> accident might have happened, obtained a lantern and actually returned,</p>
      <p> searched for and found his seals, and got back to the English lines again in</p>
      <p> safety. These seals he used to the day of his death.</p>

      <p> 14th century with the daughter of Lawrence Fraser, the heiress of Drummelzier,</p>
      <p> or perhaps in virtue of the then more recent marriage with the heiress of</p>
      <p> Fruid, the family had quartered the arms of Fraser with their own, and that</p>
      <p> the quartering was then still in use. It was this branch of the family,</p>

      <p> and from which sprang a long line of descendants, some of whom migrated</p>
      <p> into Yorkshire and later on to Bromley and Widmore in Kent; and possibly</p>
      <p> the Cornish family of Tweedy are also a branch of this house. Their</p>
      <p> Arms are to be found on the ancient monuments at Stock Church and</p>
      <p> Sampford Parva Church, in Essex, to which reference is made later on ;</p>
      <p> they are perhaps the only existing branch that has an actual specific record</p>
      <p> of descent from the Drummelzier family, and may be regarded as the only</p>
      <p> existing known direct representatives of that line. How George "who came</p>
      <p> out of Scotland from the house called Drummelzier" spelt his surname himself is</p>
      <p> not known, and spelling was not of any importance in those days, but his son</p>
      <p> Richard wrote it " Twedye," and his grandson William as  " Twyddie," though</p>
      <p> it is given  " Tuedy" on his monument, and unlike their brethren in Scotland</p>
      <p> who eventually called themselves  " Tweedie," this branch finally adopted the</p>
      <p> spelling   "Tweedy." Arthur Hearne Tweedy, the present representative,  -fo ZXd xVs Colleae</p>
      <p> carries as his arms " Argent a saltire engrailed between two escallops in fesse Englano.</p>

      <p> On a letter dated 27th May, 1807, written by a J. Tweedy from Stinfold Horsham to a William Tweedy (of the Cornish branch) is an impression of the seal bearing a boar's head with the motto " Thole and think on," and the initials J. T., whilst the late Henry John Tweedy, of Lincoln's Inn, a member of the Cornish branch, had in his possession old seals showing the usual Coat of Arms of the family, viz., " Argent a saltire engrailed gules a chief Azure," but with an arm, armed, proper, couped at the shoulder, holding a dagger and protruding from a cap, for a crest, with the motto " Rappe fort virtus sit dux," which establishes the presumption of kinship, although the earliest record of this branch is of a " Mr. Tweedy," who must have been born about the year 1640, and from him descends a long line of the name who have attained to eminence in Cornwall. William Tweedy, the first of this family who settled there, was a prominent member of the Society of Friends and of the Cornish Bank; his son, William Mansell Tweedy, was also a most prominent public man, being at one time or another of his life connected with almost every local institution of the county, Chairman of the Cornish Railway Company, a founder and President of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and treasurer of many county societies, and there is a memorial window to him in Kenwyn church. Robert Tweedy, another William Tweedy, and Robert Milford Tweedy were no less distinguished, and the present members of the family are their worthy successors.</p>

      <p> This branch traces its descent from Thomas Tweedy, Alderman and</p>
      <p> High Sheriff of Dublin about 1775, a very distinguished man who is</p>
      <p> described in the records of Dublin City as having obtained the freedom of</p>

      <p> forefathers of this Thomas Tweedy.</p>

      <p> Tweedie of London shows the arms of Tweedie impaled with those of a</p>
      <p> wife, and a palm and laurel branch crossed, for a crest, with the motto,</p>
      <p> " Aut pax aut bellem ; " and in Burke's general Armory we find, " Tweedie</p>

      <p> General William Tweedie, C.S.I., has in his possession an ancient seal handed down to him through his father the Rev. William Tweedie of Edinburgh, and his father's father before him, shewing as a crest " a demi-lion holding an anchor 5 ' with the motto "Fide et Fortitudine," the crest being the same as that which Thomas Stevenson Tweedie of Quarter adopted in lieu of the boar's head, though the motto is different.</p>
      <p> In the Spectator, under a discussion on the definition of a "gentleman," the editor of that paper observes:—</p>
      <p> " To make the right to coat armour the test of a gentleman is of course supremely ridiculous, but to say this is not to deny the great interest and value that attach to heraldic and genealogical research. A man should know as much as he can about his ancestors, and has every right to be proud of a long sequence of armigeri. But the longer and better a true bred Englishman's blood and pedigree, the less will he want to take away the name of ' gentleman' from those who deserve it on grounds of nature, conduct and bearing ;" with which sentiments we fully agree.</p>
      <p> The ancient tombstones and memorials of the Tweedies are but few. Chambers says of the family, " their principal place of sepulture was a vault in the old church of Drummelzier where was carved their coat of arms bearing a fierce bull's head with the motto, ' Thol and think,' an admonition singularly at variance with the impetuosity of their character."

      <p> certain to what Chambers refers, but there is yet to be seen over one of the doors of Drummelzier church, embedded in the old wall, an ancient stone upon which are carved the arms, with the Saltire engrailed, the motto, " Thol and think," and the legend "Hie jacet Honorabilis Vir Jacobus Tweedie de Drummelzer, obit 29th July, 1612 ;" and, according to an old MS. note, dated 3rd February, 1840, this stone was at some previous date found in the aisle at Drummelzier church and put over the door, it is supposed by one of the heritors.</p>
      <p> In Tweedsmuir Churchyard there is a stone known as the "Oliver" stone with the following inscription: " Here lyes Patrick Tweedie and his son John, both of Oliver. Thomas Tweedie of Oliver, who died 7th May, 1731, aged 75, and Christian Williamson, his spouse, 13th May, 1709, aged 51. James Tweedie of Oliver, 10th August, 1753, aged 70, and Margaret Ewart, his spouse, 1st February, 1772, aged 85; Margaret, his daughter, 23rd November, 1774, aged 49; Christian, her sister, 13th March, 1775, aged 52; Thomas Tweedie of Oliver, who died 6th March, 1803, aged 75 ; Jean Brown, his spouse, who died 1809; Lawrance Tweedie of Oliver, who died 25th January, 1837, aged 70." On this stone are the lines:—</p>
      <p> " Death pities not the aged head, Nor manhood fresh and green, But blends the locks of 85 With ringlets of 16."</p>
      <p> It is noticeable that the date of the death of Christian, the wife of Thomas of Oliver, which should be 1709 as given above and as is shown by the parish registers, has been inadvertently changed at some time to 1700 on the stone, an easy error to fall into when clearing out or restoring the letters.</p>
      <p> In Tweedsmuir Churchyard there is a stone known as the "Quarter" stone which bears the following inscription: " Here lyes Thomas Tweedie of Quarter, second son of Thomas Tweedie of Oliver, who died 9th February, 1776, aged 75 years, as also Mary Stevenson, his spouse, who died 3rd February, 1784, aged 83 years; also Alexander Tweedie of Quarter, their son, who died 13th February, 1803, aged 57 years; and Anne Carmichael, his spouse, who died 11th March, 1836, aged 77, and their son Michael, 4th May, 1789, aged 3; and to the memory of their son, Lieutenant Alexander Tweedie, Madras Army, who died at Ellichpore, 19th November, 1818, aged 29."</p>
      <p> In regard to this stone also it may be pointed out that the parish registers give the 6th of January, 1784, as the date of the death of Mary Stevenson, the date on the stone being probably the day of her burial.</p>
      <p> There are more stones in both this and other churchyards, and several members of the family have of late been buried in the private burial place in the grounds of Rachan House.</p>

      <p> p. 291. which is characterised by Chambers as perhaps the oldest of several of the</p>
      <p> more interesting of the old monuments there. It bears the name of</p>
      <p> John Tweedie, who died 1699; another John Tweedie, Provost of the Burgh,</p>
      <p> who died 1712, besides wives and daughters. In allusion to the number</p>
      <p> who have been conveyed to the dust the following lines are yet to be</p>
      <p> read:—</p>
      <p> " A silent scattered flock around they lie, Free from all toil, care, grief, fear, envy, But yet again they all shall gather'd be When the last awful trumpet soundeth hie."</p>
      <p> The armorial bearings of the family are engraved on the stone, which</p>
      <p> abounds as well in quaint sculptured figures emblematical of the four seasons</p>
      <p> —a husbandman in the act of sowing; a woman with a garland of flowers ;</p>
      <p> a young man with a reaping hook over his arm ; and a boy with his fingers</p>
      <p> in his mouth, representing winter ; it also contains an instance of that curious</p>

      <p> far no solution of this mark has been arrived at.</p>
      <p> A stone in Broughton Churchyard bears the following inscription:—</p>
      <p> 1R. 0. 5. 1609=1620 p. 644.</p>
      <p> It is understood from enquiry that this stone had been brought, whence it is not known, and set up in the churchyard. It apparently has reference, from the initials on it, to a George Haddon, who married a Nicole Tweedie, and George and Nicole are no doubt the same persons referred to in the Crown Charter before mentioned, dated 19th February, 161S, whereby King James confirmed an indeftment by George Haddon under a contract of marriage dated 5th August, 1596, giving to Nicole Tweedie, his spouse, lawful daughter of the late Adam Tweedie of Dreva, half of the lands and Barony of Brouchton, with the Manor place, for her life.

      <p> Archibald Douglas, Archdeacon of Glasgow, and William Tweedie of the Wrae. The Haddons were a very old family in Broughton, dating back at least to the days of David II., and possibly the above stone was originally used not as a churchyard memorial stone but on some house built by George Haddon and Nicole Tweedie in 1617, and afterwards inhabited and repaired in 1725 by Richard, Andrew, William, James, and David Tweedie, but who the latter were is not known for certain, it is likely that they were of the Dreva branch.</p>
      <p> There are no tomb stones or memorials in Tweeddale of more ancient date than the above, and, indeed, it is likely that in earlier days those who were slain in the frequent quarrels were buried where they fell, and those who died in their beds lie in some quiet place on the hillside near at hand, all trace of which is lost. There must be many such forgotten resting places throughout Scotland.</p>
      <p> It will be remembered that a member of the family emigrated from Drummelzier in the 15th or 16th century to England and founded the branch of Tweedy of Essex. In the church of Stock Harvard cum Ramsden Bellhouse, in Essex, is still to be seen the brass erected to the memory of Richard Twedye, who died in 1574, though it is curious that there is no notice whatever of his burial in the Register Book. This brass consists of the coat of Arms at the top, then a full length effigy in complete plate armour, and at the bottom the following inscription :—</p>
      <p> " The corpes of Richard Twedye, Esquire, lyeth buried here in tombe, Bewrapt in clay so reserved until the joyeful dome ; Whoe in his lyffe hath served well against the Ingleshe foes In forren lands, and eke at home his countrye well yt knowes, The prince he served in courte full long a pensioner fitt in personage, In his Country a Justice eke a man full grave and sage, Foure almes howses here hath he builte for foure poore knightes to dwell, And them endewed with stypendes lardge enough to kepe them well, In ffiftye eyghte yeares his course he ran and ended ye 28th of Januarye, 1574."</p>
      <p> In the arms is to be noticed the coat of the family, the blazoning being Quarterly 1st Argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief azure for Tweedie, 2nd Azure a cross pattee ermine between three cinquefoils or for Frazer, 3rd Argent an orle between eight martlets sable for Winnington, and 4th Azure three bears muzzled or for Barwick with (apparently) a falcon, with outspread wings as a crest, the motto is omitted. This brass is affixed to the South Wall, it is about 3 feet high by 18 inches wide, and the stone in which it is fixed is the old altar, as is shewn by the five crosses, two of which only are visible, one being under the brass and the other two cut off by the curve.</p>
      <p> The monument of William Twedy, a son of this Richard Twedye, stands in the church of Sampford Parva in Essex. On this tomb are the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-150"/>
      <p> arms of the family, in colours, Argent a saltire engrailed gules a chief azure, with the differences of the border of the shield being also engrailed, and the whole surrounded with a bordure ; a falcon with outspread wings for the crest appears in bold relief at the top, the motto again being omitted. Underneath William Twedy and his wife are portrayed in profile, both kneeling, he on the left, she on the right, facing each other, he in plate armour, and both in the ruffs of the period with a prayer desk between them. Below runs a long inscription in Latin, the translation of which is to the following effect:—</p>
      <p> " Here lies the body of William Twedy, Esquire, who distinguished himself as a military commander first under Queen Elizabeth of glorious memory in suppressing the tumults in the north of England, next under the invincible hero the Lord Baron de Willoughby in France, and lastly under the auspices of the illustrious Earl of Leicester in the Netherlands, and was Warden of the military works at Bergen-op-Zoom. He married firstly Mabell, the daughter of Sir Henry Curwen, Knight, of the County of Cumberland, by whom he had one son and one daughter, and afterwards married Margaret, the daughter of Rooke Green, Esquire, of Sampford Parva, in the County of Essex, by whom he had three sons and twice as many daughters. He died on the 7th July, 1605, whose soul rest in peace."</p>
      <p> In the church of St. Mary, Castlegate, York, is a tablet to the memory of Elizabeth, the wife of John Tweedy, upon which again appear, with those of his wife, the arms of the husband as argent a Saltire engrailed gules a chief azure, but without any crest or motto; on the tablet is the following inscription, " In memoriam Elizabeth Joannis Tweedy Arm. Ebor. uxoris Semper deflendae quae turn vi Animi pene plus quam muliebri turn eximia morum suavitate praedita est et omnes officii partes quas matrem at que uxorem praestare oportebat cumulate explevit Hoc Marmor Moerens Posuit Maritus. Nat VI. Non IVL. MDCCLXX. OB. III. Non. Dec. MDCCCXI."'</p>
      <p> The family of Twitty of Worcester are a branch of the Tweedys of Essex, as appears from the Visitations of Worcestershire in 1682-3, edited by Walter C. Metcalfe and privately printed in 1883, where their pedigree is given commencing with " Twitty alias Tweedy, a younger son of the Tweedys of Essex."</p>
      <p> It may not be here amiss to record that Melrose Abbey, that great memorial of Scottish architecture and ecclesiastical history, owes its existence to an ancestor of the family. A Charter granted between the years 1291 and 1306 runs thus:—"To all the sons of Holy Mother Church present and n^tia im "mb M future who shall see or hear the present writing, Symon Fraser, knight, son p. 319 IRo. 356. and heir of the late Sir Simon Fraser greeting in the Lord;" the document then goes on to confirm the lands of the Abbey " to God and to the Church of St. Mary of Melros and to the Monks serving and to serve God there</p>

Simon Fraser's Seal is appended to this charter, to which the witnesses are Sir Andrew Fraser, Knight; William Perer, late Sheriff of Tweeddale ; Stephen of Glenquholm ; Robert Hastinges; Patrick of Malville; Michael of Hytteton ; with sundry others. It will be remembered that Simon Fraser was the" father of the heiress who brought Drummelzier into the family and thus became the ancestress of the main stock of the family of Tweedie.</p>

      <p> THE TOWERS AND HOMES OF THE FAMILY.</p>
      <p> ROFESSOR VEITCH, who knew every foot of the district, tells us that the abandoned towers or dwelling places standing in Tweeddale still form one of the most characteristic and suggestive features of Tweedside. The ruined Border peel meets you, he says, on many a knowe, but as a rule not much of it remains. In many cases the tower itself, with the quaint human life carried on within it, the comfort or what little there was of it, the terror and alarm, the hopes and fears, the courage to face danger, all have equally passed away, and seldom now have we aught but the solitary ash, whose roots are enwoven beneath the green mound, where once the hall was bright and the hearthstone gleamed.</p>
      <p> The word " peel," which is universally used of these Border Castles, is the same name as the Cymri gave to their hill dwellings. " Pill" in British and Cornish, as well as in the language of ancient Gaul, signifies a moated or fossed fort, and like the old circular forts of the Cymri, the mediaeval towers are built carefully in sight of each other and may be traced all the way up the valley of the Tweed, from Berwick to the Beild, near Oliver. The Professor considers that it would be difficult to fix the exact date of the erection of any existing building or ruin in the shape of a Border Castle. They were so frequently destroyed and rebuilt in the reigns of the early Stuarts, that we must, he considers, regard what remains of them rather as representing to some extent the more ancient form of structure, than as the actual buildings of the time of Robert the Bruce and his son.</p>
      <p> From the earliest days of mediaeval times the Castles and Strongholds Scottteb ffiorocr. were the characteristic features of the old Scottish landscape. Alexander Hume of Polwarth in his poem,   "Thanks for a Summer Day," written in the days of King James VI., refers to them :—</p>
      <p> " The rayons of the sunne we see</p>
      <p> Diminish in their strength ; The schad of everie towre and tree,</p>
      <p> Extended is in lenth ; Great is the calm for everie quhair</p>
      <p> The wind is settin downe; The reik thrawes right up in the air,</p>
      <p> From everie towre and towne."</p>

      <p> THE SITE OF TINNIES CASTLE.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-156"/>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-157"/>
      <p> Very few of these old towers are now entire. The professor draws a striking picture of what one was like in the days when they formed the only  ~^ ist -  * ^f ct&gt; residences of the inhabitants of Tweeddale. The external appearance was vol. ii. cbap. 1. that of a solid square mass of masonry, generally the greywacke of the      * district, perforated with holes, or boles, which admitted air and light and also served for defence. It was usually perched on a knoll or eminence, perhaps the top of a scarped rock with a craggy face; the Tweed itself, or one of the tributary waters or burns, flowed near; some birches and hazels, an ash or an elm, dotted the knoll ; and on the green braes a few sheep or cattle quietly pastured.</p>
      <p> These towers were usually places of great strength and were seldom fjjg^  &amp; ipoctrg</p>
      <p> of more than three storeys. The lowest, or apartment on the ground floor, °ftbe</p>
      <p> 11 1     j ii c   r       .   ■ . 1 Scottlsb ttoroer.</p>
      <p> was almost universally vaulted; and this was frequently the case with the</p>
      <p> storey immediately above, forming the hall or dining room. The ground</p>
      <p> floor apartment was probably the storehouse for the Martinmas Mart and</p>
      <p> winter provisions generally. It might in some cases have been a refuge</p>
      <p> for the cattle about the tower in times of danger. Occasionally there were</p>
      <p> two vaulted chambers on the ground floor, divided by a thick wall, as in</p>
      <p> the ancient Castle hill of Manor. The second and third storeys accommodated</p>
      <p> the family, with what comfort or decency it would be, perhaps, painful to</p>
      <p> imagine. There was usually a narrow spiral stair leading to the top, on</p>
      <p> which there were projecting battlements, often machicoules, and in the</p>
      <p> centre of the space there, a kind of gabled cattage, which served both</p>
      <p> as kitchen and watch tower. Here also on the top or roof storey of the</p>
      <p> peel was the bartisan, the passage round and behind the battlements, which</p>
      <p> served as a place of outlook, and also as the withdrawing room for the</p>
      <p> ladies of the household on a quiet summer afternoon or evening. On the</p>
      <p> edge of the upper wall or roof, or attached sometimes to the chimney, hung</p>
      <p> an iron cone, sunk in an iron grating,  " the fire pan," filled with fuel, peat  „      , ,</p>
      <p> s          &amp; r     \   Scottleb</p>
      <p> and pine root, ready to be lit at the moment of alarm. The tower had Bnttqutttcs,</p>
      <p> generally two doors, an inside wooden one, of uncommon strength, studded</p>
      <p> with iron nails with broad heads, and an outside iron gate that opened on</p>
      <p> the inside. One of these doors and gates was preserved in the Parish of</p>
      <p> Broughton for a long time as a piece of antiquity, and was seen by many</p>
      <p> persons so late as 1793.     "These Castles," says Dr. Johnson, "afford another</p>
      <p> evidence that the fictions of romantic chivalry had for their basis the real</p>
      <p> manners of the feudal times, when every Lord of a Seignory lived in his p cnn e CU jk</p>
      <p> stronghold lawless and unaccountable, with all the licentiousness and ftweeooalc</p>
      <p> ....   , P- 255.</p>
      <p> insolence of uncontested superiority and unprincipled power." There was</p>
      <p> usually a court yard in front of the tower, surrounded by a wall called the S )ts !:^®? et : 3 J   '   J Scottfsb JBorocr</p>
      <p> barmkyn, the access to which was through a strong iron gate or studded vol. it., cbap. i. oaken or ashen door. According to the Act of Parliament, 12th June, 1535,      '</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-158"/>
      <p> the wall of the barmkyn was to be one ell thick, roughly, thirty seven inches, and six ells in height, that is, over eighteen feet. The space enclosed was sixty feet, and within this the cattle could be driven at night, or in case of a surprise. Inside or around the courtyard enclosed by the barmkyn were the huts or dwellings of the immediate retainers of the family.</p>
      <p> The internal fittings of these towers were, no doubt, rude enough. The upper or convex part of the vaulted roof of each storey was usually covered with a wooden floor, and, as a precursor of the modern carpet, the boards were generally strewn with the bent grass of the moors, or the rushes of the haughs. With these would be mingled sweet smelling herbs, such as thyme, bed-straw, or fresh heather. The fragrance of the hillside would thus at least for a time be felt in the narrow and ill-lighted rooms. Glass was rare and costly, and the narrow boles that served for windows were either left wholly open, or they were fitted with a board that served as a shutter. Well on into the time of the Stewarts " glessin-work "— opus vitreum —was found only in the houses of the wealthy. Gawain Douglas, in his famous prologue, on Winter, prefixed to the Seventh Book of the /Eneid, speaking of getting up in the raw winter morning, tells us that he:—</p>
      <p> " Bad beit the fyire, and the candill alycht Syne blessit me, and, in my weydis dycht Ane schot wyndo unschet, a lytill on char Per saivit the mornyng bla, wan and har."</p>
      <p> This window, evidently without glass, was common at the time, and the lines almost give a chilly feeling of the cold raw air entering in the early dawn of winter, through the " unschet" or open aperture that served to admit light and air.</p>
      <p> The significant feature of the picture, when these peels were the important points of the district, is that of the iron cone sunk in the iron grating which holds the bale or need-fire, the meaning of the word being originally a flame, a blaze, then signal fire. To quote the old Border Law, " And in the time of warfare, the beacon  ... in the fire pan be keeped, and never fail burning so long as the Englishmen remain in Scotland; and with one bell . . . which shall ring whenever the fray is . . . and whoever bides from the fray, or turns again so long as the beacon burns, or the bell rings, shall be holden as partakers to the enemies, and used as traitors."</p>
      <p> No signal ever stirred the breast more deeply, or told its story more clearly and picturesquely than that glaring bale-fire. It did its work with incredible rapidity—a rapidity quite telegraphic. Each tower was situated so as to catch the warning from its neighbour at a distance frequently of only 2 or 3 miles. When of an evening at the Fireburn, near Coldstream, the bale-fire flared out, the answering flame rose and was seen so speedily</p>

      <p> all up Teviotdale, up Ettrick and Yarrow, and up Tweeddale to its furthest wilds, that by the early morning ten thousand armed men have been known to meet together at a single place of rendezvous.</p>
      <p> Professor Veitch, from whom we have quoted, ends with the following fine reflections : " It was the flame of the beacon fire along these valleys and streams, so often lit, which fused the people into a common body, kept them true to their allegiance to the Scottish king and the Scottish nationality. Hate and resistance to the Southerner, the common interest of self-defence, banded them into a unity among themselves, and kept them from breaking off from the king who nominally reigned over them, but really only ruled in Fife and the Lothians. He was to them a rallying centre against a common and powerful foe, and little more than this. The 'Hammer of the Scots' and those who kept on hammering, while they thought to break, only welded them at every stroke into a harder and more inseparable nationality."</p>
      <p> And if it thus formed the national character so did it that of the individuals. In the letter written to Pope John XXII., in which the people of the country ask him to require the English king to respect the independence of Scotland and mind his own affairs, they say, " So long as a hundred of us are left alive we will never in any degree be subjected to the English"; and they never were.</p>
      <p> Tradition unmistakably points to Tinnies Castle as one of the earliest strongholds of the Tweedies, or of those who afterwards came to bear that surname when surnames came into fashion, and although Chambers says there is no historical record, we do actually find in the register of the Great Seal John Tweedie described as Lord of Thanes Castle in Drummelzier in IReg. (Sreat Seal the Charter granted to him by James IV. of the Home Huntaris lands in *i 0 3568 the Barony of Innerleithen.</p>
      <p> Tinnies Castle stood at the opening of the highway down the Strath of</p>
      <p> Biggar Water to the Tweed, and is not improbably the Fort of Tweed  ^ e   £ W ee&amp;, £ C , (</p>
      <p> referred to as Alt-Teutha in one of the oldest Ossianic poems entitled " Calthon Professor Wcltcb</p>
      <p> . P« 215.</p>
      <p> and Colmal." When speaking of the upper reaches of the river, Chambers,</p>
      <p> .   .   .   . Cbambcrs' "feist,</p>
      <p> in his history of Peeblesshire, says of this place, that in no part of Scotland pcebleesblre</p>
      <p> was there any feudal keep so like a robber's castle on the Rhine as that of p '</p>
      <p> Tinnies, which, occupying the summit of a lofty knoll, towered over the</p>
      <p> plain of Drummelzier, and was in all respects a fitting residence for one</p>
      <p> who set the law at defiance. Tinnies, or Tinnis, is, it is suggested, a</p>
      <p> corruption of Dinas, which is one of the Generic names in Cymric for a</p>
      <p> fort; it is also supposed to be a corruption of   " Thanes" Castle, and the</p>
      <p> remains are of such antiquity that there is no record of its erection, or</p>
      <p> destruction—at least so says the New Statistical account of Scotland; but</p>
      <p> at all events there is in existence the royal warrant for its demolition during gSt^&amp;^utt</p>
      <p> the occupation of James Stewart, dated 13th July, 1592, at Peebles, when P-73.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-162"/>
      <p> the fortalice was to be "cussen down to the ground." George Chalmers, in his Caledonia, says, " it was the residence of the Tweedies who domineered there through ages of anarchy," and Chambers and Pennycuik both also state that Tinnies was originally the residence of the head of the clan Tweedie. Tradition names Udard, a second son of Gilbert Fraser of Neidpath, as its builder some time in the 12th century; but whether he actually built the castle or merely repaired and strengthened it is doubtful. A great quantity of boars' tusks and of the bones of other animals has been dug out of the hill on which the ruins lie, and old John Fleming at Drummelzier says there were also human bones amongst the rubbish carted as manure for the Drummelzier Haugh field, and that the quantity of these was so great that the farmer had to have them buried in the churchyard. There is also an old legend of a secret passage between Tinnies and Drummelzier, as well as of a great cave close to the former castle, and the suggestion might be hazarded that it was a vault for sepulture, as evidenced by the bones. Udard, the possible builder of Tinnes, is sometimes spoken of as Udard the Dane, which may furnish a possible clue to the name as originally Danes Castle, hence Thanes and Tinnies. It must have been a place of greater strength than the ordinary feudal keeps in Peeblesshire, for the walls are two Scots' ells thick, and the cement as hard as the stone. It is said to have consisted of a quadrangular enclosing wall between 6o and 70 feet square, with round towers 18 feet in diameter at each angle. The tower at the northern angle was still standing in 1834 to the height of about 5 feet, and had three shot holes in it, and the foundation of the western tower was also then visible, while there were traces of the other two. The walls of the towers were about 4 feet thick and the "curtains" between them about 5 feet thick. The remains now consist of only a few broken but durable fragments of wall, and are reached by a zig-zag pathway up the steep bank which in the present day is reduced to the nature of a sheepwalk. The view from Tinnies Castle hill is one of the finest in the district.</p>
      <p> Pennecuik, in his Tweeddale, and Chalmers, in his Caledonia, say that Neidpath Castle was also at one time a residence of the Tweedies, but if so it must have been in very early days. Neidpath occupies a striking situation on the north bank of the Tweed, at a distance of one mile westward from the town of Peebles, is backed with woody hills, has an open prospect to the east, and consists properly of two castles united. Originally the structure had consisted of a tall border tower or peel, each storey vaulted, and with a spiral stair communicating with the different floors. The south side of the ancient tower is entirely gone, leaving a series of vaulted floors one above the other, and the fallen wall lies in large fragments at the bottom of the cliff near the Tweed.

      <p> had their abode at Neidpath it must have been in the old peel, and not in the castle as it now stands.</p>
      <p> Far up the Tweed in the Parish of Tweedsmuir, almost opposite the church and adjoining the Beild, on a rocky shoulder of the hill, with an outlook eastwards over the valley, is the site of Oliver Castle, of which not a single fragment is now standing. Oliver was a very early possession of the family, and it is possible that here resided the ancestor who married Sir Simon Fraser's daughter, or grand-daughter, the heiress of Drummelzier. It must have been originally a very strong place both from its position and from its size, which is still apparent, although only an indistinct outline and a few stones are to be seen, while the site is covered by trees. The place is known locally as "The Leddy Knowe." Curiously enough no relic has been found about this site except a pair of thumb-screws, an instrument of torture used even as late as the times of the Covenanting persecution. It is more than likely that many of the stones were used to build the house of the Beild in 1726, and the new Oliver house in 1780.</p>
      <p> Not far from the site of Oliver Castle, and on Over Oliver, stands the present house of Oliver surrounded by trees and gardens and overlooking the river. This house was built by Thomas Tweedie of Oliver, about the year 1780, to replace the old house, of which traces still remain in the ancient stones with the arms carved upon them built into the present buildings, and which are referred to by Stodart in his work on Scottish Arms as bearing the dates 1649 and 1734. The building of this house was evidently going on in the year 1790, for it is mentioned in the correspondence that passed between Thomas Tweedie of Oliver and his son Adam Ewart Tweedie, and previously to this there is said to have been another Oliver house, on higher ground, but still on Over Oliver, probably built when Oliver Castle became no longer habitable. Near Oliver is the house of the Beild, which was built by James Tweedie of Oliver in 1726; over the door is the inscription, J.T., 1726, M.E., meaning James Tweedie and Margaret Ewart.</p>
      <p> Drummelzier Castle, however, as one of the homes of the family, rouses lpennccutk the chief interest, for it is here that the head of the family is found seated p, 253  &amp;c. during the most prominent period of the family history.</p>
      <p> Chalmers in his Caledonia says the singular name of Drummelzier "Galeoonta," (pronounced drummellier) arises from the ridge lying to the northern end °f nM 31 ^l^os the parish, and it has been suggested that it means the ridge of Melzier or Meldred, who is said by some to have been a great chief of the district, drum being the generic part of the word. Drym in British and drum in Irish both mean a ridge. The affix Melzier, or Meldred, is not so easily explained, however, if it be not accepted as the name of a person ; drum'eallur, in the Irish, would signify the ridge of earth or the earthern ridge ; but the whole ^cct'orB of word is possibly the. British Drym-Meillaur, meaning the dwelling on the Scotland p. 9S</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-166"/>
      <p> ridge. The oldest form of this name which appears in writing is Drumedler. Fordun gives Dunmeller, melr being old Norse for bent grass, but this is probably an inaccuracy in the spelling.</p>
      <p> Whatever may have been the date of the original building that stood upon the site of the peel of Drummelzier, the present Castle, commonly called Drummelzier Place, is considered by those qualified to judge to have been erected or restored to its present form about the end of the 15th century, very possibly in consequence of the various edicts issued about that time by the King, for the repairing and strengthening of all the Border fortresses. It stands upon a low rocky knoll close down upon the Tweed, and is shattered and ruined and much gone on the western side, but there is sufficient to show its original height and character. The angle tower and a portion of the main building alone now remain ; the wing is vaulted and provided with shot holes, and each window is also furnished with a shot hole under the sill. By an inlet from the Tweed it could be surrounded with water. Chambers in his history of Peeblesshire thinks that it probably suffered bombardment by the troops of the Commonwealth at the same time as Neidpath Castle, and remarks that its shattered side is towards the low hill of Rachan whence it could be attacked by cannon. Since its ruin its stones have unfortunately been used for the farm steadings near, and it is a matter of regret that some effort could not be made to secure it from further dilapidation, for historically it possesses an interest equal to that ot any ruin in the county. Seen from the bend of the Tweed, opposite the Castle, the view is very fine, reminding one very distinctly of the Rhine scenery. The Castle is discovered to sight from far down, and at that particular place the Tweed has a most picturesque sweep.</p>
      <p> On Fruid Water, one of the earliest tributaries of the Tweed, the name meaning the impulsive, or hasty water, far up in the wilds of the Parish of Tweedsmuir are the remains of Fruid Castle, constantly mentioned as one of the strongholds of the Tweedies. Little now remains of it, and that little is hidden in the trees surrounding the ancient site. It was once, no doubt, of considerable strength, partly on account of its position in the wild and inaccessible district where it stood. Traditionally it is said to have come into the family through the same alliance with the Frasers as brought in Drummelzier, but it is more likely that it came by the marriage that ensued from the feud with the Flemings in the 16th century.</p>
      <p> Fruid formed almost the last of the string of fortresses for common defence along the Tweed. It looked to the castle of Hawkshaw ; Hawkshaw looked to Oliver Castle; Oliver to Polmood ; Polmood to Kingledoors; Kingledoors to Stanhope ; Stanhope to Mossfennan ; Mossfennan to Wrae and Drummelzier ; Drummelzier to Tinnies, Dreva, Lour, Dawyck, Stobo, and so on all the way to the Mouth of the Tweed.</p>

      <p> In the Parish of Glenholm in Peeblesshire, a little South ot Rachan ilbambcrs' and nearly opposite to Drummelzier Castle, overlooking the Tweed, is Wrae p C |^L es6bire Castle, or rather the ruins of it, for it is reduced to a single fragment, which is striking from its strangely isolated condition. The sole remaining portion of the old feudal keep is the angle of the building which had contained the stair, and being additionally strong on this account, it has been more successful in defying the weather and time than the rest of the building. Wrae was for many years one of the strongholds of the family, and was usually occupied by a near relative of the head of the sept, and after the loss of Drummelzier Castle the representative of the Drummelzier line appears to have retired to this Tower.</p>
      <p> On the face of the hill beyond the Stobo Slate Quarry, on the high ground overlooking the plain of Drummelzier, is Dreva, formerly one of Cbambere the fortalices of the Tweedies. Of the peel itself, however, nothing remains, V-  +39 although near by is the British hill fort of Dreva Craig. It also was usually occupied by one of the near relatives of Tweedie of Drummelzier.</p>
      <p> Another ancient residence of the family was the House of Halmyre</p>
      <p> in the parish of Newlands. It passed, however, out of the hands of the</p>
      <p> Tweedies in the first quarter of the 17th century, on which occasion it will</p>
      <p> be remembered that certain members of the family attacked the newlv  ® xiv V Counc "</p>
      <p> J IRecorOs. installed owner with swords and other weapons and nearly killed him. The</p>
      <p> house stands on the banks of the Lyne Water in a district which was originally</p>
      <p> a dismal swamp, and, as Chambers says, evidently takes its name from the</p>
      <p> marshy character of the ground in which it was placed. The old house</p>
      <p> of Halmyre stood on a kind of slight eminence, and was a vaulted and</p>
      <p> defensible fortalice, not easily assailed. The present building, which is the</p>
      <p> result of restoration in the middle of the nineteenth century, consists in</p>
      <p> the lower storey of two vaulted apartments, relics of the ancient feudal</p>
      <p> keep, which Pennecuik says was built by the "eminent and powerful Baron lP c ""ccu(f?</p>

      <p> Tweedie of Drummelzier." p. 175.</p>
      <p> Kingledoors, now a farm house, lies at the junction of the Kingledoors Burn with the Tweed and opposite Stanhope, in the Parish of Drummelzier. In ancient times the upper part of the Strath of Kingledoors was noted for a chapel dedicated to St. Cuthbert, but this has long ago disappeared. There are many records of the occupation of Kingledoors by various members of the family. In old documents the place is usually described as Chapel Kingledoors, and near it stood another dwelling, called Craig Kingledoors. The name is an excellent example of the Celtic original, cinn gill dor —" head of the clear water."</p>
      <p> Patervan, sometimes spelled Putervan and Potervan, close to Kingledoors on the opposite side of the Tweed, was for man}' years the residence of generations of Tweedies.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-170"/>
      <p> Hearthstanes, in the parish of Tweedsmuir, was long occupied by Tweedies. In the extraordinary litigation which took place in the year 1780 about Polmood, a neighbouring property, Margaret Tweedie, " the guidwife of Hearthstane," is referred to as the niece of Uncle Robert Hunter, the owner of the wonderful dog Algiers; and when Uncle Robert grew old the guid wife of Hearthstane took care of him until his death ; Hearthstanes, or Hairstanes, as it is now called, was, until quite recently, in the occupation of Alexander Gladstone Tweedie.</p>
      <p> Quarter, which stands in the parish of Glenholm, between Biggar Water and Holms Water, came into the hands of the Tweedies about the year 1740, when it was acquired by Thomas Tweedie, the second son of the Thomas Tweedie of Oliver. Chambers says, " this may be called the beginning of a new branch of the Tweedies, who by descent claim to be representatives of the ancient Tweedies of Drummelzier." The house, which has been well restored, is a good example of its kind, with the curious turret so often seen in Scottish and French architecture.</p>
      <p> Rachan House stands at the junction of the Holms Water and Biggar Water with the Tweed in the parish of Glenholm ; the present residence was practically built by Thomas Stevenson Tweedie of Quarter, who acquired the property on his return from India, and the work was completed by his son, James Tweedie of Quarter and Rachan, with the result that it is now one of the finest places of its kind in the county, surrounded by large gardens and a fine park, with a picturesque lake in the grounds.</p>
      <p> Many other places were also possessed or occupied by the family in Tweeddale, such as Whitslaid, Glenrath, Menzion, Hall Manor, and others, which for long years at one time or another were connected with the family.</p>
      <p> As has been elsewhere mentioned, a member of the family of the Drummelzier branch migrated to England and settled in Essex early in the 16th century. His actual relationship is not known, but he is referred to in the Herald's Visitations for Essex as " George Twedy who came out of Scotland of the house called Drummelzier "; his descendants lived at Boreham Stock Harvard cum Ramsden Bellhouse, and at Sampford Parva in the County of Essex, and later on an elder son, John Tweedie, and his son, John Drummelzier Tweedie, were resident at Warley House, Halifax, in Yorkshire ; they were both Justices of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenants for that County, and that branch expired in John Drummelzier Tweedie, who died without issue. A younger son, Colonel George Tweedy, settled at Bromley, Kent, where the family has been resident ever since, and is now represented by Arthur Hearne Tweedy of Widmore Lodge, Widmore, Bromley, Kent; this family also owns the estate of The Hoo, Kempston, in Bedfordshire, with the manors of Kempston Greys, Hardwick and Hastingbury, as well as the house of Widmore House, Bromley, Kent, where they have long been</p>

      <p> resident, and which, strangely enough, was brought into the family by marriage with a Veitch, a descendant of the ancient enemies of the Tweedies in Tweeddale.</p>
      <p> Early in the last century a new branch of the family was established at Rolvenden, in Kent, by the late Captain Michael Tweedie, R.A., the younger son of Alexander Tweedie of Quarter, to whom we have already referred. He married Frances, the heiress of Richard Walter Forbes of Rawlinson, in Rolvenden, in which estate he succeeded his father-in-law, and where his descendants have been settled ever since. The house there is of great age, and in the old great open fire-place there is a fine example of an iron fire-back of unusual size and strength, with fourteen coats of arms embossed upon it, and the date, 1603; a duplicate of it is also to be seen in one of the farm-houses belonging to the property, whilst another of the farm-houses on the estate is of some peculiar interest as a good example of a 15th century dwelling, with some curious stencillings of the period on the walls of some of the rooms.</p>
      <p> The residence of the branch of the family settled in Ireland is Cloonamahon, co. Sligo, belonging to Henry Colpoys Tweedy. It was for many generations the home of his relations, the Merediths; their last representative was his wife, and on her death the property passed to him. The original house was situated in a hollow in the midst of the large old-fashioned garden, and was pulled down in the middle of the last century when the present house was built. It commands magnificent views of mountain and woodland scenery, embracing five counties ranging from the Donegal headlands in the north, through Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon to the co. Cavan. The property is of moderate size, about 800 statute acres, consisting chiefly of pasture lands and some fine old timber.</p>
      <p> It is a far cry from Europe to New Brunswick, where, however, as before mentioned, a branch of the family is found seated ; and we are enabled to give an illustration of " Elmshurst," the residence there of the Hon. L. J. Tweedie, to whom we have already referred. It is situate in the town of Chatham in Northumberland County and stands surrounded by elms in pleasant grounds stretching down to the Miramichi ("sparkling water") river. It is wood and brick built after the fashion of the country, and affords a good instance of the type of house built there in the early half of the last century.</p>
      <p> It only now remains to take our leave, having brought the record down to a period within the memory of living persons. Although written for the members of the family, it is hoped that others will have also found an interest in this history of a typical Border family, and the picture of ancient Scottish Lowland life and character which it affords. We would also express the conviction that the family vigour and vitality which no</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-150"/>
      <p> doubt largely contributed to make the early history of the Tweedies so troubled and stormy, yet survives to sustain the family and keep the name to the front in the struggle for existence, which is no less keen at the present day than in ancient times, although the warfare is of a more peaceful character.</p>
      <p> With this we thank the reader for his patience, if he be not long since out of it, and bid him farewell.</p>
