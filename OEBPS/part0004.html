      <p> The following are from the originals in the possession of the late H. J. Tweedy, of Lincoln s Inn, a member of the Cornish Branch : —</p>
      <p> To William Tweedy, Esq. Slinfold, Horsham,</p>
      <p> 27th May, 1807. Dear Sir,—Enclosed I   beg to send you the long promised poem, such as it is, literally founded on fact. Happy if it afford you the least interest or entertainment. My wife joins me in everything kind to yourself and family. I am, with great respect, Dear Sir, Your humble servant, J. TWEEDY.</p>
      <p> THE VAGRANT YOUTH, 1707.</p>
      <p> A FRAGMENT. This is the last of these youthful trifles, these first fruits ot the author's literary labors or leisure. The tale it alludes to was told him on the spot, and the impression it made upon him was not likely to be effaced by Ossian's beautiful poem of " Calthon and Colmal," which he has perused repeatedly since and which always gave him new pleasure-Far in a narrow winding vale Where *Teutha loves to stray, And green hills lift their dewy heads To meet the morning ray, 'Twas there a meek-eyed man of God A vagrant youth espied, And in a fond familiar tone, " Hail, vagrant youth !"   he cried, " Are not you your father's only son ? In you I  ween I trace His manner, air, the very form And features ol his face ; Then listen to an old man's tale— In your young ears 'tis new—</p>
      <p> These hills and dales, these herds and flocks,</p>
      <p> They all belong to you.</p>
      <p> Once as the naiad of the vale,</p>
      <p> To yonder circling pool,</p>
      <p> Loose o'er the silver sandbed stole</p>
      <p> Her beauteous limbs to cool,</p>
      <p> Sudden uprose the river God</p>
      <p> And caught her in his arms,</p>
      <p> And bore her to his wind-crowned isle,</p>
      <p> And robbed her of her charms.</p>
      <p> On the same sandbed, lo!   anon,</p>
      <p> Just new come from the skies,</p>
      <p> And all in rainbow robes arrayed,</p>
      <p> A little cherub lies.</p>
      <p> The heavenly sign the swains adore,</p>
      <p> They run, they reach the place,</p>
      <p> Press to their breast the babe; the babe</p>
      <p> * Tweed.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-230"/>
      <p> 2 30     *   Appendix.</p>
      <p> Looks smiling in their tace.</p>
      <p> By day, by night this babe they guard,</p>
      <p> His innate name record,</p>
      <p> Expatiate on his mystic birth,</p>
      <p> And hail their future Lord.</p>
      <p> On yon mooned mound, whose grass green base</p>
      <p> The conscious pool still laves,</p>
      <p> And still where nods yon tufted tower</p>
      <p> To the half viewless waves,</p>
      <p> There, there for him they reared apace</p>
      <p> fAlteutha's lofty dome,</p>
      <p> Of every weary wanderer,</p>
      <p> The hospitable home.</p>
      <p> There he, his sons, and his sons' sons sat</p>
      <p> In judgment in their hall,</p>
      <p> Guided the good, o'erawed the bad,</p>
      <p> And mercy shewed to all.</p>
      <p> At length in slow succession rose</p>
      <p> Dunthalmo, great in fame,</p>
      <p> One only child Dunthalmo had,</p>
      <p> And Colmal was her name.</p>
      <p> Now Colmal was a matchless maid,</p>
      <p> The fairest of the fair;</p>
      <p> Blue was her eye, lily-white her hand,</p>
      <p> And flaxen white her hair.</p>
      <p> One youth she loved, his lowlaid hopes</p>
      <p> Her partial cares control,</p>
      <p> His native loveliness, like light,</p>
      <p> Thrills through her clouded soul,</p>
      <p> For Calthon, heir of Rathmorc, slain</p>
      <p> By her relentless sire,</p>
      <p> For Calthon, home a captive brought,</p>
      <p> She fanned a faithful fire.</p>
      <p> Ah ! not the stolen walk to the tomb</p>
      <p> Where his sire's ashes lie,</p>
      <p> The salt tear to Balclutha shed,</p>
      <p> And to the memory,</p>
      <p> Not strong hereditary hate,</p>
      <p> Not vows of vast revenge,</p>
      <p> Not all Dunthalmo's stern behests,</p>
      <p> Her maiden love could change.</p>
      <p> As some sweet nymph with her soft hand,</p>
      <p> A pale wild flower rears,</p>
      <p> Fast by some rude rock's sunless side,</p>
      <p> And waters with her tears.</p>
      <p> His fortunes thus she nursed, she sought</p>
      <p> The dark cave where he lay,</p>
      <p> Burst his base bonds, and led him forth</p>
      <p> To life, to love and day.</p>
      <p> From this rare pair an endless train</p>
      <p> Of bards and heroes rose,</p>
      <p> Who tuned to Teutha's streams their harps,</p>
      <p> | Drummelzier, Tweeddale.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-231"/>
      <p> Appendix.</p>
      <p> Or rushed upon their foes ;</p>
      <p> Who gathered to the festive halls</p>
      <p> To talk of other years,</p>
      <p> Pour in the joy of grief their souls,</p>
      <p> And triumph in their tears;</p>
      <p> Who soothed to peace their fathers' forms,</p>
      <p> With images of war,</p>
      <p> Waved to the wind the flaming sword,</p>
      <p> And hurled the rapid car,</p>
      <p> Who raised on every hill a home,</p>
      <p> Who reared Wrea's time struck walls,</p>
      <p> The long grass lines the battlements,</p>
      <p> The green thorn fills the halls.</p>
      <p> 'Twas when Cabal usurped the state,</p>
      <p> And bigotry bore sway,</p>
      <p> A ruthless ruffian came and seized</p>
      <p> This dwelling for his prey.</p>
      <p> I saw him tear from her own arms</p>
      <p> A widow's only joy;</p>
      <p> I saw him drive from her own door</p>
      <p> The widow and the boy.</p>
      <p> The widow died, the boy survived</p>
      <p> Thy grandsire's sire to be ;</p>
      <p> Now, none remains of all our swains</p>
      <p> To tell this tale but me.</p>
      <p> Since, then, thou art no vulgar youth,</p>
      <p> Betray no vulgar mind,</p>
      <p> Thyself respect, befriend thy friend,</p>
      <p> Be to thy kinsman kind,</p>
      <p> Be kind to all, in few confide,</p>
      <p> Do violence to none,</p>
      <p> To none deliver tamely up</p>
      <p> Thy rights— %Tlwle and Think on.</p>
      <p> And if when you have reached that point</p>
      <p> In life's alluring round,</p>
      <p> Where youth meets age and manhood strews</p>
      <p> With fruits and flowers the ground;</p>
      <p> And if, when you have greatly spurned</p>
      <p> The syren song of sense,</p>
      <p> And wandered where the muses still</p>
      <p> Diviner joys dispense,</p>
      <p> If haply then you meet a maid</p>
      <p> Like gentle Colmal—fair,</p>
      <p> Whose eye is blue, lily-white her hand,</p>
      <p> And flaxen white her hair,</p>
      <p> Whose fathers dwelt of old, like thine,</p>
      <p> In halls of high renown,</p>
      <p> Whose genius, softened though sublime,</p>
      <p> Marks virtue for her own,</p>
      <p> Then lead the maid the loveliest way</p>
      <p> To Hymen's hallowed shrine."</p>
